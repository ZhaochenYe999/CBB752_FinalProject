Specifically, SYNE2 and SUN2 assemble in arrays of transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines which are bound to F-actin cables and couple the nucleus to retrograde actin flow during actin-dependent nuclear movement. May be involved in nucleus-centrosome attachment. During interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) at G2 phase and nuclear migration in neural progenitors its LINC complex association with SUN1/2 and probable association with cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin motor complexes functions to pull the nucleus toward the centrosome; SYNE1 and SYNE2 may act redundantly. During INM at G1 phase mediates respective LINC complex association with kinesin to push the nucleus away from the centrosome. Involved in nuclear migration in retinal photoreceptor progenitors.

Acts as an atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase by working together with cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes and initiating ubiquitination of CRL substrates: associates with CRL complexes and specifically mediates addition of the first ubiquitin on CRLs targets (PubMed:27565346). The initial ubiquitin is then elongated by CDC34/UBE2R1 and UBE2R2 (PubMed:27565346).
