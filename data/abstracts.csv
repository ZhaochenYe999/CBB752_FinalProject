Despite its importance, the structure and molecular function of BLOC-3 remains  elusive. Here, we report the Cryo-EM structure of human BLOC-3 at 3.2 Å  resolution. The BLOC-3 complex consists of one copy of HPS1 and HPS4, which  tightly associate with each other via their longin domains (LD1 and LD3). The  unique four-helical bundle (4HB) domain of HPS1 is involved in stabilizing its  LD1 and LD2 domains. Moreover, we identify interactions between BLOC-3 and the  small GTPases RAB32/38 and RAB9A, which are essential for lysosome-related  organelle biogenesis. Functional assays using zebrafish models confirm the  significance of BLOC-3 assembly and its interaction with RAB9A during melanosome  biogenesis. Most importantly, our structural information provides an accurate  prediction for clinical variants associated with HPS. In summary, our study  provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular architecture and  functional roles of BLOC-3, shedding light on HPS pathogenesis.  © 2025. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers.  N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has a profound impact on RNA translation,  splicing, transportation, and stability. AIMS: This research aimed to identify and verify m6A-modified signatures for  Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumorigenesis. OBJECTIVE: Our previous mRNA-seq and m6A-seq data from 26 pairs of LUAD samples  and tumor-adjacent normal tissues are used. METHODS: Univariate Cox regression analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and  selection operator (LASSO) analysis were used to estimate the significance of 37  collected m6A regulators. WGCNA was constructed to identify the genes correlated  with LUAD tumorigenesis. Pearson correlation analysis between mRNA-seq and  m6A-seq data was used to identify the m6A-correlation genes. RESULTS: LASSO-Cox analysis identified 18 m6A significant regulators. The top 3  regulators, including METTL16, FTO, and SRSF10, and their downstream genes which  were reported in the literature were analysed to confirm their role in LUAD  tumorigenesis. Blue and brown coexpression modules were chosen as key modules  for LUAD tumorigenesis. At last, we intersected Lasso-downstream genes,  m6A-correlation genes, with blue or brown module genes. As a result, 56  m6A-modified gene signatures were obtained. Among them, AKAP9, PLXNB2, BRPF3,  HPS4, EXOC7, and KLF6 have an inconsistent expression in protein and mRNA  levels, probably due to m6A modification. In addition, these genes may be  involved in regulating drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: 56 m6A-modified gene signatures for LUAD tumorigenesis were  obtained from Pearson correlation analysis between mRNA-seq and m6A-seq data,  along with LASSO and WGCNA analysis. Among them, AKAP9, PLXNB2, BRPF3, HPS4,  EXOC7 and KLF6 play a crucial role in LUAD tumorigenesis in an m6A  modification-dependent manner.  © 2025. The Author(s).

The great seahorse (Hippocampus kelloggi) is one of the larger species within  the seahorse group and is widely distributed in coastal areas of the  Indo-Pacific. However, the natural resources of this species continue to  decrease, rendering it a vulnerable species that faces a high risk of  extinction. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct research on the  genetic diversity of this species to protect its genetic resources. In this  study, we conducted whole-genome re-sequencing (WGRS) on three H. kelloggi  populations from the Red Sea (RS, n = 30), the Andaman Sea (AS, n = 13), and the  South China Sea (SCS, n = 13), and a total of 1,398,936 high-quality  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The results indicate  that the average observed heterozygosity (Ho) and the average expected  heterozygosity (He) for the RS, AS, and SCS populations are 0.2031 and 0.1987,  0.1914 and 0.1822, and 0.2083 and 0.2001, respectively. The three geographic  populations exhibit a high degree of genetic differentiation with only a minimal  gene flow between them. Consistently, in a population structure analysis, the  three groups are also clearly distinguished, which is consistent with the  results of the population differentiation coefficient. Demographic analyses  revealed that the effective population size (Ne) of the SCS population underwent  a dramatic bottleneck during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), followed by a  substantial recovery, whereas the RS and AS populations maintained stable Ne  values throughout this period. To investigate adaptive responses to climate  change in the SCS population, we employed selective elimination analysis, which  identified 21 candidate genes potentially involved in environmental adaptation.  Of particular significance were myo5a, hps4, znf385a, msh3, and pfkfb4, which  likely play crucial roles in the adaptive mechanisms of H. kelloggi. This  comprehensive study not only illuminates the genetic diversity patterns of H.  kelloggi but also provides a valuable foundation for future investigations into  the species' evolutionary adaptations.

INTRODUCTION: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare autosomal recessive  disorder characterized by defective biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles.  The genetic types of HPS are associated with a spectrum of multisystemic  clinical manifestations. Phenotypic features of HPS type 1 (HPS-1) or HPS-4,  which are associated with defects in biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles  complex-3 (BLOC-3), are generally more severe than those of HPS-3, HPS-5, or  HPS-6, which are associated with defects in BLOC-2. A paucity of information is  available about renal impairment in HPS. The objective of this study is to  expand the understanding of kidney disease in HPS. METHODS: Medical records and clinical data of patients with HPS evaluated at the  National Institutes of Health Clinical Center from 1995 to 2020 were  retrospectively reviewed. For patients with more than one visit, the most recent  renal function and urinalysis tests were analyzed. Estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using standard equations (i.e., Chronic  Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, Modification of Diet in Renal  Disease). Kidney tissue sections from 5 patients with HPS-1 and 1 patient with  HPS-6 were examined. RESULTS: Records from 205 adults and 52 children with HPS were reviewed.  Calculated eGFR of adult patients with different HPS types differed  significantly, and calculated eGFR of pediatric and adult patients with BLOC-3  disorders was significantly lower than that of patients with BLOC-2 disorders.  Linear regression analysis showed that renal function progressively decreases  with age in patients with BLOC-3 or BLOC-2 disorders, but the rate of decline  was more rapid in patients with BLOC-3 disorders compared to patients with  BLOC-2 disorders. In adult patients with HPS-1, glucosuria was found in 4%,  proteinuria in 12%, hematuria in 15%, high levels of urinary β2MG in 24%, and  elevated urinary albumin to creatinine ratios in 9%. Histological examination of  kidney tissue showed accumulation of intracellular deposits of ceroid lipofuscin  in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with HPS-1. There was no  evidence of fibrosis, and glomeruli, distal renal tubular epithelial cells, and  interstitial regions appeared histologically normal. CONCLUSION: Mild impairment of renal function is a feature of HPS. Kidneys of  patients with HPS-1 contain proximal renal tubular intracellular deposits and no  histologic evidence of fibrosis. Consistent with other manifestations of HPS,  the phenotype of renal impairment is relatively more pronounced in patients with  BLOC-3 disorders than in patients with BLOC-2 disorders. Strategies to avoid  nephrotoxicity or renal tubular injury and to protect renal function should be  considered for patients with HPS irrespective of age.  © 2024 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Electronic  address: anti.vasemagi@slu.se.  Albinism is a widespread departure from a typical body colouration due to  altered melanin production. The Wels catfish (Silurus glanis) is among the  largest freshwater fish species in the world, and albino individuals occur both  in the wild and in aquaculture. Here, we performed transcriptome-wide analysis  of albino and normally pigmented S. glanis using four tissues (skin, dorsal fin,  whole eye and liver) to identify genes associated with albinism by exploring  patterns of differential expression (DE) and differential alternative splicing  (DAS). Multi-tissue analyses revealed a large number of genes in skin (n = 1355)  and fin (n = 614) tissue associated with the albino phenotype in S. glanis,  while the number of DE genes in eye and liver tissues was lower (n = 188,  n = 189, respectively). Several DE genes across multiple tissues were detected  as the most promising candidates (e.g., hsp4, hsp90b1, raph1, uqcrfs1,  adcy-family and wnt-family) potentially causally linked to the albino phenotype  in Wels catfish. Moreover, our findings supported earlier observations of  physiological differences between albino and normally pigmented individuals,  particularly in energy metabolism and immune response. In contrast, there were  only a few pigmentation-related genes observed among DAS genes (4 in skin, 2 in  fin), the overlap between DAS and DE genes was low (n = 25) and did not include  known pigmentation-related genes. This suggests that DAS and DE in Wels catfish  are, to a large extent, independent processes, and the observed alternative  splicing cases are probably not causally linked with albinism in S. glanis. This  work provides the first transcriptome-wide multi-tissue insights into the  albinism of Wels catfish and serves as a valuable resource for further  understanding the genetic mechanisms of pigmentation in fish.

BACKGROUND: Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.  Lysosomal dysfunction is implicated in cancer progression; however, prognostic  prediction models based on lysosome-related genes (LRGs) are lacking in liver  cancer. This study aimed to establish an LRG-based model to improve prognosis  prediction and explore potential therapeutic targets in liver cancer. METHODS: Expression profiles of 61 LRGs were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas  liver cancer cohorts. There were 14 LRGs identified, and their association with  clinical outcomes was evaluated. Unsupervised clustering, Cox regression, and  functional assays were performed. RESULTS: Patients were classified into high-risk and low-risk subgroups based on  the 14 LRGs. The high-risk group had significantly worse overall survival.  Aberrant immune infiltration and checkpoint expression were observed in the  high-risk group. Furthermore, HPS4 was identified as an independent prognostic  indicator. Knockdown of HPS4 suppressed liver cancer cell proliferation and  induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: This study developed an LRG-based prognostic model to improve risk  stratification in liver cancer. The potential value of HPS4 as a therapeutic  target and biomarker was demonstrated. Regulation of HPS4 may offer novel  strategies for precision treatment in liver cancer patients.  Copyright © 2023 He and Nie.

GeneReviews(®) [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle;  1993–2025. 2000 Jul 24 [updated 2023 May 25].  Author information: (1)Staff Clinician, National Human Genome Research Institute, National  Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (2)Staff Scientist, National Human Genome Research Institute, National  Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (3)Research Nurse, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes  of Health, Bethesda, Maryland (4)Clinical Director, National Human Genome Research Institute, National  Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland  CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is characterized by  oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, and, in some individuals,  pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, and/or immunodeficiency. Ocular  findings include nystagmus, reduced iris pigment, reduced retinal pigment,  foveal hypoplasia with significant reduction in visual acuity (usually in the  range of 20/50 to 20/400), and strabismus in many individuals. Hair color ranges  from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually at  least a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis  can result in variable degrees of bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding,  postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or  after tooth extraction, circumcision, and/or other surgeries. Pulmonary  fibrosis, colitis, and/or neutropenia have been reported in individuals with  pathogenic variants in some HPS-related genes. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive  lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early 30s and can progress to  death within a decade. Granulomatous colitis is severe in about 15% of affected  individuals. Neutropenia and/or immune defects occur primarily in individuals  with pathogenic variants in AP3B1 and AP3D1. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The clinical diagnosis of HPS can be established in a proband  with hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, characteristic eye findings, and  demonstration of absence of platelet delta granules (dense bodies) on electron  microscopy. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in AP3B1, AP3D1,  BLOC1S3, BLOC1S5, BLOC1S6, DTNBP1, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, or HPS6 confirms the  diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Correction of refractive errors and use  of low vision aids; preferential seating in school; low-vision consultant as  needed; UV-blocking sunglasses; surgery for strabismus as needed; protection  from sun exposure with protective clothing and sunscreen; standard treatment for  skin cancer; thrombin-soaked Gelfoam® for skin wounds with prolonged bleeding;  medical alert bracelet and bleeding management plan; humidifier to reduce  frequency of epistaxis; oral contraceptives and IUD for menorrhagia; DDAVP®  (desmopressin acetate) for wisdom tooth extraction and invasive procedures;  platelet or red blood cell transfusions for surgery or protracted bleeding;  HLA-matched single-donor platelets as needed; maximize pulmonary function with  prompt treatment of asthma and pulmonary infections; influenza, pneumococcal,  and COVID-19 vaccines; regular moderate exercise; supplemental oxygen for  advanced-stage pulmonary fibrosis; lung transplantation for end-stage pulmonary  disease; steroids, other anti-inflammatory agents, and/or Remicade® for  granulomatous colitis. Immunodeficiency, when present, is lifelong and  granulocyte colony-stimulating factor responsive, and affected individuals  benefit from an infection prevention plan. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic  examination including assessment for refractive errors; annual skin examination  for evidence of sun-induced skin damage (e.g., solar keratoses [premalignant  lesions], basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma); annual pulmonary  function testing in those older than age 20 years; colonoscopy in those with  symptoms of colitis (e.g., cramping, mucoid stools, hematochezia, melena);  assessment for clinical and laboratory manifestations of immunodeficiency.  Agents/circumstances to avoid: Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  products, aspirin-containing products, and other anticoagulants unless medically  indicated; activities that increase the risk of bleeding; all tobacco and vaping  products and inhalation of chemical and physical substances injurious to the  lungs; unprotected and direct sun exposure. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In  families with HPS3-, HPS5-, or HPS6-related HPS (milder types of HPS in which  hypopigmentation and nystagmus may not be clinically evident), it is appropriate  to clarify the status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs in order to  identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of  treatment and preventive measures. GENETIC COUNSELING: HPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both  parents are known to be heterozygous for an HPS-causing pathogenic variant, each  sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected,  a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being  unaffected and not a carrier. Once the HPS-causing pathogenic variants are  identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family  members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation  genetic testing are possible.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) represents a malignancy with a multi-factorial  combination of genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. Targeting  lysosomes presents significant potential in the treatment of numerous diseases,  while lysosome-related genetic markers for early GC detection have not yet been  established, despite implementing this process by assembling artificial  intelligence algorithms would greatly break through its value in translational  medicine, particularly for immunotherapy. METHODS: To this end, this study, by utilizing the transcriptomic as well as  single cell data and integrating 20 mainstream machine-learning (ML) algorithms.  We optimized an AI-based predictor for GC diagnosis. Then, the reliability of  the model was initially confirmed by the results of enrichment analyses  currently in use. And the immunological implications of the genes comprising the  predictor was explored and response of GC patients were evaluated to  immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Further, we performed systematic laboratory work  to evaluate the build-up of the central genes, both at the expression stage and  at the functional aspect, by which we could also demonstrate the reliability of  the model to guide cancer immunotherapy. RESULTS: Eight lysosomal-related genes were selected for predictive model  construction based on the inclusion of RMSE as a reference standard and RF  algorithm for ranking, namely ADRB2, KCNE2, MYO7A, IFI30, LAMP3, TPP1, HPS4, and  NEU4. Taking into account accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measurements, a  preliminary determination of our study was carried out by means of applying the  extra tree and random forest algorithms, incorporating the ROC-AUC value as a  consideration, the Extra Tree model seems to be the optimal option with the AUC  value of 0.92. The superiority of diagnostic signature is also reflected in the  analysis of immune features. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study is the first to integrate around 20  mainstream ML algorithms to construct an AI-based diagnostic predictor for  gastric cancer based on lysosomal-related genes. This model will facilitate the  accurate prediction of early gastric cancer incidence and the subsequent risk  assessment or precise individualized immunotherapy, thus improving the survival  prognosis of GC patients.

Macrophages are the foremost controllers of innate and acquired immunity,  playing important roles in tissue homeostasis, vasculogenesis, and congenital  metabolism. In vitro macrophages are crucial models for understanding the  regulatory mechanism of immune responses and the diagnosis or treatment of a  variety of diseases. Pigs are the most important agricultural animals and  valuable animal models for preclinical studies, but there is no unified method  for porcine macrophage isolation and differentiation at present; no systematic  study has compared porcine macrophages obtained by different methods. In the  current study, we obtained two M1 macrophages (M1_IFNγ + LPS, and M1_GM-CSF) and  two M2 macrophages (M2_IL4 + IL10, and M2_M-CSF), and compared the  transcriptomic profiles between and within macrophage phenotypes. We observed  the transcriptional differences either between or within phenotypes. Porcine M1  and M2 macrophages have consistent gene signatures with human and mouse  macrophage phenotypes, respectively. Moreover, we performed GSEA analysis to  attribute the prognostic value of our macrophage signatures in discriminating  various pathogen infections. Our study provided a framework to guide the  interrogation of macrophage phenotypes in the context of health and disease. The  approach described here could be used to propose new biomarkers for diagnosis in  diverse clinical settings including porcine reproductive and respiratory  syndrome virus (PRRSV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), Toxoplasma gondii (T.  gondii), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Haemophilus parasuis serovar 4  (HPS4), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhp), Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2), and  LPS from Salmonella enterica serotype minnesota Re 595.

Background: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HSP) was first reported in 1959 as  oculocutaneous albinism with bleeding abnormalities, and now consists of 11  distinct heterogenic genetic disorders that are caused by mutations in four  protein complexes: AP-3, BLOC1, BLOC2, and BLOC3. Most of the patients show  albinism and a bleeding diathesis; additional features may present depending on  the nature of a defective protein complex. The subtypes 3 and 4 have been known  for mutations in HSP3 and HSP4 genes, respectively. Methods: In this study, two  Pakhtun consanguineous families, ALB-09 and ALB-10, were enrolled for clinical  and molecular diagnoses. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the index patient in  each family followed by Sanger sequencing of all available samples was performed  using 3Billion. Inc South Korea rare disease diagnostics services. Results: The  affected individuals of families ALB-09 and ALB-10 showed typical phenotypes of  HPS such as oculocutaneous albinism, poor vision, nystagmus, nystagmus-induced  involuntary head nodding, bleeding diathesis, and enterocolitis; however, immune  system weakness was not recorded. WES analyses of one index patient revealed a  novel nonsense variant (NM_032383.4: HSP3; c.2766T > G) in family ALB-09 and a  five bp deletion (NM_001349900.2: HSP4; c.1180_1184delGTTCC) variant in family  ALB-10. Sanger sequencing confirmed homozygous segregation of the disease  alleles in all affected individuals of the respective family. Conclusions: The  substitution c.2766T > G creates a premature protein termination at codon 922 in  HPS3, replacing tyrosine amino acid with a stop codon (p.Tyr922Ter), while the  deletion mutation c.1180_1184delGTTCC leads to a reading frameshift and a  premature termination codon adding 23 abnormal amino acids to HSP4 protein  (p:Val394Pro395fsTer23). To the best of our knowledge, the two novel variants  identified in HPS3 and HPS4 genes causing Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome are the  first report from the Pakhtun Pakistani population. Our work expands the  pathogenic spectrum of HPS3 and HPS4 genes, provides successful molecular  diagnostics, and helps the families in genetic counselling and reducing the  disease burden in their future generations.

Author information: (1)Laboratory of Membrane Trafficking Mechanisms, Department of Integrative Life  Sciences, Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Aoba-ku, Sendai  980-8578, Miyagi, Japan.  B16-F1 melanoma cells have often been used as a model to investigate  melanogenesis, but the evidence that melanosome biogenesis and transport occur  by the same mechanisms in normal melanocytes and B16-F1 cells is insufficient.  In this study, we established knockout B16-F1 cells for each of several key  factors in melanogenesis, i.e., tyrosinase (Tyr), Hps4, Rab27A, and Rab32·Rab38  (Rab32/38), and then compared their phenotypes with the phenotypes of  corresponding mutant mouse melanocyte cell lines, i.e., melan-c, melan-le,  melan-ash, and Rab32-deficient melan-cht cells, respectively. The results showed  that Tyr and Rab27A are also indispensable for melanin synthesis and peripheral  melanosome distribution, respectively, in B16-F1 cells, but that Hps4 or its  downstream targets Rab32/38 are not essential for Tyr transport in B16-F1 cells,  suggesting the existence of a Rab32/38-independent Tyr transport mechanism in  B16-F1 cells. We then performed comprehensive knockdown screening of Rab small  GTPases and identified Rab10 and Rab24, previously uncharacterized Rabs in  melanocytes, as being involved in Tyr transport under Rab32/38-null conditions.  Our findings indicate a difference between the Tyr transport mechanism in  melanocytes and B16-F1 cells in terms of Rab32/38-dependency and a limitation in  regard to using melanoma cells as a model for melanocytes, especially when  investigating the mechanism of endosomal Tyr transport.

Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized  by improper biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LROs). Lung fibrosis is  the leading cause of death among adults with HPS-1 and HPS-4 genetic types,  which are associated with defects in the biogenesis of lysosome-related  organelles complex-3 (BLOC-3), a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for a small  GTPase, Rab32. LROs are not ubiquitously present in all cell types, and specific  cells utilize LROs to accomplish dedicated functions. Fibroblasts are not known  to contain LROs, and the function of BLOC-3 in fibroblasts is unclear. Here, we  report that lung fibroblasts isolated from patients with HPS-1 have increased  migration capacity. Silencing HPS-1 in normal lung fibroblasts similarly leads  to increased migration. We also show that the increased migration is driven by  elevated levels of Myosin IIB. Silencing HPS1 or RAB32 in normal lung  fibroblasts leads to increased MYOSIN IIB levels. MYOSIN IIB is downstream of  p38-MAPK, which is a known target of angiotensin receptor signaling. Treatment  with losartan, an angiotensin receptor inhibitor, decreases MYOSIN IIB levels  and impedes HPS lung fibroblast migration in vitro. Furthermore, pharmacologic  inhibition of angiotensin receptor with losartan seemed to decrease migration of  HPS lung fibroblasts in vivo in a zebrafish xenotransplantation model. Taken  together, we demonstrate that BLOC-3 plays an important role in MYOSIN IIB  regulation within lung fibroblasts and contributes to fibroblast migration.  © 2022. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a group of heterogeneous genetic  diseases characterized by a reduction or complete lack of pigmentation in the  hair, skin, and eyes. It is associated with reduced visual acuity, nystagmus,  photophobia, and strabismus. OCA type 1 (OCA1) and type 2 (OCA2) are caused by  mutations in the tyrosinase (TYR) and OCA2 genes, which are responsible for most  cases of OCA. The present study aimed to identify the mutational spectra of 18  southwest Chinese probands with OCA. RESULTS: We used a skin disease-targeted panel to sequence more than 400 genes,  including 23 genes (TYR, OCA2, AP3B1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S6, C10orf11, DTNBP1, FRMD7,  GPR143, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, LYST, MC1R, MITF, MLPH, MYO5A, RAB27A,  SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TYRP1) associated with syndromic and non-syndromic albinism.  The targeted panel was applied to 18 patients from southwest China, nine (50%)  patients were diagnosed with OCA1, and nine (50%) were diagnosed with OCA2. Our  data indicate that OCA1 and OCA2, the most common subtypes, probably have the  same prevalence in southwest China. In total, we identified 26 variants in TYR  and OCA2 from 18 OCA cases using the NGS technology, including 24 variants  presented in the Human Gene Mutation Database Professional (HGMD) and two novel  variants, c.559_560insCATTATTATGTGTCAAATTATCCCC in TYR and c.1514 T > C in OCA2,  which have not been previously reported. According to the American College of  Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification,  c.559_560insCATTATTATGTGTCAAATTATCCCC (p.G190Cfs*12) is classified as a  pathogenic variant, and c.1514 T > C (p.F505S) is evaluated as a likely  pathogenic variant. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel variants were identified which will expand the mutational  spectra of TYR and OCA2. The results of the present study may have implications  for genetic counseling, carrier screening, and clinical management of the  disease.  © 2022. The Author(s).

Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) is a commensal bacterium in the upper  respiratory tract of pigs that can also cause the swine Glässer disease, which  induces an intensive inflammatory response and results in significant economic  losses to the swine industry worldwide. G. parasuis can cause disease through  infection of the respiratory tract, resulting in systemic infection, but the  mechanism is largely unknown. Recently we showed that Glaesserella parasuis  serotype 4 (GPS4) increased swine tracheal epithelial barrier permeability,  resulting in easier bacterial translocation. Tight junction proteins (TJ) play a  crucial role in maintaining the integrity and impermeability of the epithelial  barrier. GPS4 decreased the expression of the TJ ZO-1 and occludin in swine  tracheal epithelial cells (STEC). Furthermore, the proinflammatory cytokines  IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α were significantly upregulated in GPS4-infected STEC, and  both the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways were activated and contributed to the  expression of TNF-α. We demonstrate that the production of proinflammatory  cytokines, especially TNF-α, during GPS4 infection was involved in barrier  dysfunction. Additionally, animal challenge experiments confirmed that GPS4  infection downregulated TJ in the lungs of piglets and induced a severe  inflammatory response. In general, G. parasuis infection downregulated the  expression of TJ and induced massive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines,  resulting in epithelial barrier disruption and favoring bacterial infection.  This study allowed us to better understand the mechanism by which G. parasuis  crosses the respiratory tract of pigs.  © 2021. The Author(s).

Here we develop the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  as a model system for studying the developmental genetics of cichlid color  patterns. We identified 4 types of pigment cells: melanophores, xanthophores,  iridophores and erythrophores, and characterized their first appearance in  wild-type fish. We mutated 25 genes involved in melanogenesis, pteridine  metabolism, and the carotenoid absorption and cleavage pathways. Among the 25  mutated genes, 13 genes had a phenotype in both the F0 and F2 generations. None  of F1 heterozygotes had phenotype. By comparing the color pattern of our mutants  with that of red tilapia (Oreochromis spp), a natural mutant produced during  hybridization of tilapia species, we found that the pigmentation of the body and  eye is controlled by different genes. Previously studied genes like mitf,  kita/kitlga, pmel, tyrb, hps4, gch2, csf1ra, pax7b, and bco2b were proved to be  of great significance for color patterning in tilapia. Our results suggested  that tilapia, a fish with 4 types of pigment cells and a vertically barred  wild-type color pattern, together with various natural and artificially induced  color gene mutants, can serve as an excellent model system for study color  patterning in vertebrates.  © The American Genetic Association. 2021.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown  aetiology with a poor prognosis. Studying genetic diseases associated with  pulmonary fibrosis provides insights into the pathogenesis of the disease.  Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder  characterised by abnormal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, manifests  with oculocutaneous albinism and excessive bleeding of variable severity.  Pulmonary fibrosis is highly prevalent in three out of 10 genetic types of HPS  (HPS-1, HPS-2 and HPS-4). Thus, genotyping of individuals with HPS is clinically  relevant. HPS-1 tends to affect Puerto Rican individuals due to a genetic  founder effect. HPS pulmonary fibrosis shares some clinical features with  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), including dyspnoea, cough, restrictive lung  physiology and computed tomography (CT) findings of fibrosis. In contrast to  IPF, HPS pulmonary fibrosis generally affects children (HPS-2) or middle-aged  adults (HPS-1 or HPS-4) and may be associated with ground-glass opacification in  CT scans. Histopathology of HPS pulmonary fibrosis, and not IPF, shows  vacuolated hyperplastic type II cells with enlarged lamellar bodies and alveolar  macrophages with lipofuscin-like deposits. Antifibrotic drugs approved as  treatment for IPF are not approved for HPS pulmonary fibrosis. However, lung  transplantation has been performed in patients with severe HPS pulmonary  fibrosis. HPS pulmonary fibrosis serves as a model for studying fibrotic lung  disease and fibrosis in general.  The content of this work is not subject to copyright.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge about inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with  Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by defective biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, could  provide insights into IBD in general. OBJECTIVE: To expand the understanding of IBD in patients with HPS. METHODS: Retrospective review of records from patients with HPS evaluated at the  National Institutes of Health Clinical Center from 1995 to 2019 was conducted.  Clinical features of IBD, genotyping results and histologic findings of  colectomy specimens were analysed. RESULTS: IBD affected 37 (14.2%; 12 male, 25 female) of 261 patients with HPS.  Median age of onset was 17 years; range was 1 to 52 years. The most common  symptoms of HPS IBD were hematochezia, abdominal pain and loose stools. Fistulae  or extra-intestinal manifestations developed in 30% or 22%, respectively.  Genotyping showed that patients with biallelic variants in HPS1, HPS3, HPS4 or  HPS6 were diagnosed with IBD. Six children had very early-onset IBD. Patients  with HPS-3 had mild manifestations of IBD. Medical therapy and bowel resection  were utilized to treat 73% and 35% of patients with HPS IBD, respectively; 7 of  13 patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy had prolonged  clinical responses. Active cryptitis, chronic inflammatory changes, granulomas  and ceroid lipofuscinosis were histopathologic findings in three colectomy  specimens. CONCLUSIONS: IBD resembling Crohn's disease affects some patients with HPS;  genetic heterogeneity is a feature of HPS IBD. HPS3 is a new gene associated  with human IBD. Very early-onset IBD can develop in HPS.  © Published 2021. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public  domain in the USA.

Previously, we  discovered an antimicrobial pathway dependent on Rab32 and BLOC-3 (BRAM) that is  critical to kill S. Typhi in murine macrophages. The BLOC-3 complex is comprised  of the two sub-units HPS1 and HPS4 and exhibits guanine-nucleotide exchange  factor (GEF) activity to Rab32. In melanocytes, Rab9 has been shown to interact  with HPS4 and RUTBC1, a Rab32 GTPase activating (GAP) protein, and regulate the  Rab32-mediated melanosome biogenesis. Intriguingly, Rab9-deficient melanocytes  exhibit hypopigmentation, a similar phenotype to Rab32 or BLOC-3 deficient  melanocytes. Additionally, VPS9-ankyrin-repeat-protein (VARP) has been shown to  regulate melanocytic enzyme trafficking into the melanosomes through interaction  with Rab32. Although Rab32, Rab9 and VARP are a part of melanogenesis in  melanocytes, whether Rab9 and VARP are required for the BRAM mediated killing in  macrophages is currently unknown. Here we showed that HPS4 is recruited to the  Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCV) and over-expression of BLOC-3 significantly  increased Rab32-positive bacteria vacuoles. We found that SCV acquire Rab9,  however over-expressing Rab9 did not change HPS4 localization on bacteria  vacuoles. Importantly, we used shRNA to knock-down Rab9 and VARP in macrophages  and showed that these proteins are dispensable for Rab32 recruitment to the SCV.  Furthermore, we assessed the survival of S. Typhimurium in macrophages deficient  for Rab9 or VARP and demonstrated that these proteins are not essential for BRAM  pathway-dependent killing.

Periodic albinism of a widely used albino mutant of Xenopus laevis caused by  deletion of two exons in the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 4 gene.  Fukuzawa T(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Biology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.  The periodic albino mutant of Xenopus laevis is a recessive mutant, in which  reduced amounts of melanin appear in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in  melanophores at the late embryonic stage, after which both RPE and melanophores  gradually depigment. Three types of pigment cells (melanophores, iridophores and  xanthophores) have been reported to be affected in this albino. However, the  causative gene of the periodic albinism remains unknown. Hermansky-Pudlak  syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects humans and mice,  which is caused by defective biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LROs).  Two subgenomes (L and S) are present in the allotetraploid frog X. laevis.  Comparison of genes between the chromosomes 1L and 1S revealed that the HPS type  4 (hps4) gene was present only in chromosome 1L. In the albino mutant, a 1.9 kb  genomic deletion in the hps4.L gene including exons 7 and 8 caused a premature  stop codon to create a truncated Hps4 protein. Injection of wild-type hps4.L  mRNA into mutant embryos rescued the albino phenotype. These findings indicate  that hps4 is a causative gene for the periodic albinism in X. laevis. The  phenotype of this mutant should be reassessed from the perspective of LRO  biogenesis.  © 2020 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Infants born very preterm are more likely to experience neonatal  morbidities compared to their term peers. Variations in DNA methylation (DNAm)  associated with these morbidities may yield novel information about the  processes impacted by these morbidities. METHODS: This study included 532 infants born < 30 weeks gestation,  participating in the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants  study. We used a neonatal morbidity risk score, which was an additive index of  the number of morbidities experienced during the NICU stay, including  bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), severe brain injury, serious neonatal  infections, and severe retinopathy of prematurity. DNA was collected from buccal  cells at discharge from the NICU, and DNAm was measured using the Illumina  MethylationEPIC. We tested for differential methylation in association with the  neonatal morbidity risk score then tested for differentially methylated regions  (DMRs) and overrepresentation of biological pathways. RESULTS: We identified ten differentially methylated CpGs (α Bonferroni-adjusted  for 706,278 tests) that were associated with increasing neonatal morbidity risk  scores at three intergenic regions and at HPS4, SRRD, FGFR1OP, TNS3, TMEM266,  LRRC3B, ZNF780A, and TENM2. These mostly followed dose-response patterns, for 8  CpGs increasing DNAm associated with increased numbers of morbidities, while for  2 CpGs the risk score was associated with decreasing DNAm. BPD was the most  substantial contributor to differential methylation. We also identified seven  potential DMRs and over-representation of genes involved in Wnt signaling;  however, these results were not significant after Bonferroni adjustment for  multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal DNAm, within genes involved in fibroblast growth factor  activities, cellular invasion and migration, and neuronal signaling and  development, are sensitive to the neonatal health complications of prematurity.  We hypothesize that these epigenetic features may be representative of an  integrated marker of neonatal health and development and are promising  candidates to integrate with clinical information for studying developmental  impairments in childhood.

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been associated with  cardiovascular disease in the general population, with a causal role observed in  animal models. In the general population, the effect of CHIP is greater for  somatic mutations in pre-defined CHIP driver genes other than DNMT3A (referred  to as non-DNMT3A CHIP). We sought to assess the prospective association between  CHIP and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. METHODS: CHIP was measured by high-depth targeted sequencing. The primary  analysis tested the association of somatic mutations in non-DNMT3A CHIP driver  genes with a composite cardiovascular disease endpoint of myocardial infarction,  stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease in 5,043  patients with CKD in four prospective cohorts. Sensitivity analyses examined the  effect of CHIP subtypes, race, baseline comorbidities, APOL1 risk alleles, and  IL6R p.Asp358Ala genotype. RESULTS: At baseline, patients had a mean age of 66 ± 12 years and eGFR of 43 ±  18 ml/min/1.73m2. CHIP was present in 24% of patients, with 13% of all patients  carrying acquired non-DNMT3A mutations. Non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a  36% higher risk of the composite cardiovascular endpoint [95% confidence  interval (CI), 6% - 76%]. Among composite components, non-DNMT3A CHIP was  associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.10 - 2.47). Baseline  eGFR, diabetes status, or race did not alter the association of non-DNMT3A CHIP  with cardiovascular risk. Those without genetically reduced interleukin-6  signaling (non-carriers of IL6R p.Asp358Ala) had worse disease (HR 1.46; 95% CI  1.17- 1.83, Psubgroup difference = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CKD, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with  cardiovascular disease with an effect size similar to that reported in the  general population.

BACKGROUND: The APOL1 high-risk haplotype has been associated with chronic  kidney disease (CKD) and the deterioration of kidney function, particularly in  populations with West African ancestry. However, the mechanisms by which APOL1  risk variants increase the risk for kidney disease and its progression have not  been fully elucidated. METHODS: We compared methylation (N = 3,191; 715 [22%] carriers), proteomic (N =  1,240; 169 [14%] carriers), and metabolomic (N = 6,309; 674 [11%] carriers)  profiles in African and Hispanic/Latino carriers of two APOL1 high-risk alleles  (G1/G1, G2/G2, G1/G2) and non-carriers (G0/G0), excluding heterozygotes (G0/G1,  G0/G2), from the PAGE Consortium and UK BioBank. In each study, the associations  between the APOL1 high-risk haplotype and up to 722,719 CpG sites, 2,923  proteins, or 836 metabolites were estimated using covariate-adjusted linear  regression models, followed by fixed-effects sample size weighted meta-analyses. RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between APOL1 high-risk  haplotype and methylation at 52 CpG sites, with 48 located on chromosome 22 and  18 in the vicinity of APOL1 - 4 and MYH9. All significant CpG sites near APOL2  were hypomethylated, whereas those near APOL3 and APOL4 were hypermethylated.  APOL1-associated CpG sites were also identified in genes involved in ion  transport and mitochondrial stress pathways. Sensitivity analyses indicated  consistent yet attenuated effects among heterozygotes, supporting an additive  effect of APOL1 risk alleles. Further analyses of the 52 CpG sites identified  two near APOL4 exhibiting G1-specific effects, eight associated with CKD but  none with eGFR, and three showing heterogeneity by CKD status. Additionally,  carrying two APOL1 risk alleles was associated with higher plasma APOL1 protein  (β = 1.12, PFDR = 2.26e-70) and lower C18:1 cholesteryl ester metabolite (Z =  -4.50, PFDR = 4.83e-3). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate differential methylation, proteomic, and  metabolomic profiles associated with APOL1 high-risk haplotypes.

Albuminuria is associated with high-risk apolipoprotein-L1 variants (APOL1  G1/G2) in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, this gene variant  does not account for all chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. We hypothesized that  we could develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CKD in SCA, combining APOL1  G1/G2 with other candidate genes that modify SCA severity and further stratify  patients into risk categories based on this risk score. Variants in APOL1, HMOX1  (rs743811), BCL11A (rs1424407), and α-thalassemia (α-3.7) were identified in  children with SCA enrolled in the Sickle Cell Clinical Research and Intervention  Program longitudinal cohort (SCCRIP). We individually tested the association of  these variants with persistent albuminuria, tested a three-variant PRS (PRS-3)  (APOL1, BCL11A (rs1424407), and α-3.7), and developed a four-variant PRS (PRS-4)  after adding HMOX1 (rs743811) to PRS-3 using the summation of high-risk alleles.  An adult SCA cohort from the University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC), was used for  validation. Persistent albuminuria was defined as having a urine  albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g on at least 2 of 3 consecutive  measurements. In both cohorts, APOL1 risk variants increased the risk while  α-thalassemia protected against persistent albuminuria. PRS-4 was significantly  associated with persistent albuminuria (SCCRIP: p = 0.004; UIC: p = 0.00016).  When stratifying patients into three and four risk categories based on the PRS,  58% and 86% of the high-risk (PRS-3) and 54% and 89% of very high-risk (PRS-4)  categories developed persistent albuminuria cases in the SCCRIP and UIC cohorts,  respectively. A PRS may identify high-risk SCA patients for albuminuria.  Applying this PRS to guide the early implementation of disease modifiers and  renoprotective therapies may help reduce the burden of SCA-related CKD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With the advent of antiretroviral therapy, people with HIV  (PWH) are living longer and are at risk of developing age-related comorbid  illnesses, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this review  article is to summarize recent advances in the diagnosis and management of  kidney disease in PWH, and ultimately inform clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Individuals of West African descent are often genetically  predisposed to develop CKD. Among carriers of the APOL-1 risk variant, Na+/K+  transport has been identified as the proximal driver in APOL-1-mediated  pathogenesis. The use of urine biomarkers in CKD diagnosis among PWH has been  supported and is comparable to the general population. Additionally, novel CKD  therapies, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like  peptide 1 receptor agonists can potentially offer significant clinical benefit  to PWH with CKD. SUMMARY: Despite being an underrepresented group in clinical trials, recent  research findings have broadened our understanding of kidney disease in PWH.  Given that PWH experience an increased risk of developing CKD, early detection  and management is vital in improving quality of life and overall healthcare  outcomes.

We aimed to characterize the underlying genetics of kidney stone disease (KSD)  in an urban and diverse population using the Natera Renasight genetic panel.  This was a single-center prospective study of high-risk KSD patients, defined as  recurrent stone formers or those with a family history with KSD. Buccal saliva  DNA samples were collected with the commercially available Natera Renasight  genetic panel and were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. The panel  assesses 385 kidney disease related genes, including 45 linked to KSD. One  hundred eleven high-risk KSD patients were enrolled. The majority were female  (56%) with a median age of 50 (IQR 39.5-59.5), compromising a diverse ethnic  background with 62% Hispanic, 23% White and 11% Black. Patients had median 3  (IQR 2-5) lifetime stone episodes, and 41% had family history of KSD. Genetic  analysis was possible for 105 patients (95%). Eight (8%) had positive tests with  only one patient found to have a pathogenic mutation associated with KSD  (SLC7A9, cystinuria). The other 7 positive tests included amyloidosis (TTR,  N = 3), Alport syndrome (COL4A3, N = 2), polycystic kidney disease (PKD1,  N = 1), and susceptibility to ESRD (APOL1, N = 1). Patients with positive tests  were more likely to have chronic kidney disease (38% vs 5%, p < 0.01), gout (13%  vs 1%, p = 0.02) and carbonate apatite stones (38% vs 7%, p < 0.01). Our study  sheds light on genetic factors of KSD in a diverse patient population. The  results suggest that KSD is unlikely monogenetic in nature, but is more likely  due to a complex interplay of polygenetic and environmental influences. Genetic  testing may be most useful in KSD patients with chronic kidney disease.  © 2025. The Author(s).

Genetic profiling and molecular biology methods have made it possible to study  the etiology of the end-stage organ disease that led to transplantation, the  genetic factors of compatibility and tolerance of the transplant, and the  pharmacogenetics of immunosuppressive drugs and allowed for the development of  monitoring methods for the early assessment of allograft rejection. This study  aims to report the design and baseline characteristics of an integrated  personalized genetic approach in solid organ transplantation, including  whole-exome sequencing (WES) and the monitoring of dd-cfDNA by dPCR. Preliminary  results reported female recipients with male donors undergoing two pediatric and  five adult kidney and three heart transplantations. WES revealed a pathogenic  mutation in RBM20 and VUS in TTN and PKP2 in heart recipients, while kidney  donors presented mutations in UMOD and APOL1 associated with autosomal-dominant  kidney diseases, highlighting the risks requiring the long-term monitoring of  recipients, donors, and their family members. %dd-cfDNA levels were generally  stable but elevated in cadaveric kidney recipient and one pediatric patient with  infectious complications and genetic variants in the ABCB1 and ABCC2 genes.  These findings highlight the potential of combining genetic and molecular  biomarker-based approaches to improve donor-recipient matching, predict  complications, and personalize post-transplant care, paving the way for  precision medicine in transplantation.

Objective: To identify proteins associated with the risk of gastric cancer (GC)  and build a protein risk score for risk prediction of GC based on proteomic  analysis. Methods: Gastric mucosal proteomics data were used to construct  Dataset One, comprising 94 GC cases and 230 individuals with different stages of  gastric mucosal lesions. The GC cases were recruited from the National Upper  Gastrointestinal Cancer Early Detection (UGCED) Program in Linqu, Shandong  Province, as well as clinical patients from the Fifth Medical Center, General  Hospital of PLA, and Peking University Cancer Hospital. Non-cancer individuals  were enrolled from the National UGCED Program in Linqu and community screening  programs at the Dongfang Hospital. All participants were pathologically  confirmed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify  gastric mucosal proteins significantly associated with GC risk. Subsequently,  plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP)  were used to construct Dataset Two, including 40 baseline GC cases and 47 933  non-cancer individuals, and Dataset Three, comprising 138 incident GC cases and  47 933 non-cancer individuals during a prospective follow-up period. In Dataset  Two, multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess  associations between plasma protein levels and baseline GC risk. In Dataset  Three, multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to examine associations  with the risk of incident GC. A poly-protein risk score (PRS) was developed  using a weighted summation method based on protein effect sizes from Dataset  Two. Its associations with GC risk and the progression of gastric mucosal  lesions were evaluated using linear regression trend tests. Results: A total of  324, 47 973 and 48 071 participants were included in Datasets One, Two, and  Three, respectively. Across the three datasets, the proportions of males and  individuals aged>60 years were higher in the GC group than in the non-GC group  (all P values<0.05). The follow-up period in Dataset Three had a M (P25, P75) of  14.47 (13.7, 15.2) years, with a median of 7.4 (4.6, 11.3) years for those who  progressed to GC. Based on Dataset One, 2 524 tissue-differential proteins  associated with GC risk were identified through multivariate logistic regression  analysis adjusted for age and sex. Among these, seven proteins were consistently  associated with GC risk across tissue and plasma levels in Datasets Two and  Three, with consistent directions of association. Five proteins (MRC1, APOL1,  BST2, PON2, and GGH) were positively associated with GC risk, while two (GSN and  CLEC3B) were negatively associated. Analysis of the PRS based on these seven  proteins showed that for each standard deviation increase in the tissue-derived  PRS, the risk of GC increased by 6.26 times (95%CI: 4.02-9.75). In Dataset Two,  each standard deviation increase in the plasma-derived PRS was associated with a  2.13-fold increase in GC risk (95%CI: 1.68-2.69). In the prospective cohort of  Dataset Three, individuals in the high PRS group had a 2.27-fold higher risk of  GC compared to the low PRS group (95%CI: 1.50-3.45). Moreover, each standard  deviation increase in the plasma PRS was associated with a 57% higher risk of GC  (HR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.34-1.84). Additionally, the tissue-derived PRS showed an  increasing trend with the progression of gastric mucosal lesions. Conclusion:  The tissue and plasma proteomics identified seven individual proteins that may  indicate the risk of developing gastric cancer, showing the potential as  biomarkers for aiding in the screening of gastric cancer.  Publisher: 目的： 基于蛋白质组学识别与胃癌风险存在关联的蛋白并构建预测胃癌风险的蛋白评分。 方法：  依托胃黏膜组织蛋白质组学数据构建数据集1，纳入胃癌病例94例和不同胃黏膜病变阶段研究对象230例，胃癌病例来源于山东临朐胃癌高发现场的国家上消化道癌早诊早治项目、解放军总医院第五医学中心及北京大学肿瘤医院的临床诊断患者；非患癌研究对象则来自山东临朐国家上消化道癌早诊早治项目和北京中医药大学东方医院的社区筛查，所有个体均经病理诊断确认。采用多因素logistic回归分析筛选与胃癌风险显著相关的胃黏膜组织蛋白。随后，基于英国生物银行蛋白质组学项目（UKB-PPP），纳入基线胃癌病例（40例）与未患癌者（47  933名）构建数据集2，将前瞻性队列随访期间胃癌患者（138例）与未患癌者（47  933名）纳入数据集3。基于数据集2和3，分别采用多因素logistic回归模型分析和多因素Cox比例风险回归模型，探讨组织差异蛋白在血浆中的水平与基线胃癌风险及前瞻性队列随访胃癌发生风险的关联。基于数据集2的每个蛋白效应值，通过加权求和方法构建多蛋白风险评分，并进一步通过线性回归方法进行趋势性检验，评价其与胃癌及不同胃黏膜病变的关联。  结果： 数据集1、2和3的分别纳入324、47 973和48  071位研究对象，3个数据集中，胃癌组男性占比和>60岁者的占比均高于非胃癌组（均P<0.05）。数据集3的随访时间M（P25，P75）为14.47（13.7，15.2）年，其中进展为胃癌组的随访时间M（P25，P75）为7.4（4.6，11.3）年。基于数据集1，调整年龄和性别的多因素logistic回归分析得到2524个组织层面的差异蛋白，随后依托数据集2和3，筛选出7个在胃黏膜组织和血浆层面均与胃癌关联且所有关联方向均一致的蛋白，其中5个（MRC1，APOL1，BST2，PON2和GGH）与胃癌呈正向关联，2个（GSN和CLEC3B）与胃癌呈负向关联。随后依托7个蛋白构建的多蛋白风险评分（PRS）分析结果显示，组织PRS每增加1个标准差，胃癌风险增加至6.26倍（95%CI：4.02~9.75）。数据集2中血浆PRS每增加1个标准差，胃癌风险增加至2.13倍（95%CI：1.68~2.69）；在数据集3的前瞻性队列中，与低评分组相比，高评分组的胃癌发病风险增加至2.27倍（95%CI：1.50~3.45）；风险评分每增加1个标准差，胃癌发病风险增加57%（HR=1.57，95%CI：1.34~1.84）。并且胃黏膜组织PRS随病变加重呈现上升趋势。  结论： 基于蛋白质组学筛选出7个可能指示胃癌发生风险的个体蛋白，可作为胃癌辅助筛查标志物。.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of tumor-related  mortality, characterized by short patient survival times and limited treatment  options. Some targeted therapies have not succeeded in improving patient  prognosis. Tumor membranes possess potential target specificity, offering hope  for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy and drug treatment. METHODS: In this study, we collected gene expression and survival data from two  scRNA-seq projects and patient cohorts in TCGA, ICGC, and GEO. Differential  analysis and dimensionality reduction clustering were employed to isolate tumor  epithelial cells. High-expression membrane-associated genes in tumor epithelial  cells were identified through PPI network analysis and functional enrichment.  Subsequently, membrane-associated genes associated with patient prognosis were  selected using LASSO and Cox regression to construct MaGPS, which was validated  in external datasets. Potential therapeutic targets of the MaGPS signatures were  identified and confirmed by integrating spatial transcriptomics, scRNA-seq, and  protein expressions. In addition, drug sensitivity analysis was performed to  explore potential targeted drugs associated with MaGPS. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the identification of a specific tumor  epithelial cell cluster, c0. This cluster expressed 17 membrane-associated genes  that are closely interconnected and play roles in extracellular interactions.  The MaGPS model, developed based on the membrane-associated genes LMO7, APOL1,  SLC2A1, C15orf48, FXYD3, and CLDN18, effectively predicted patient prognostic  risk. Additionally, the expression of the six MaGPS signatures was observed to  be elevated in tumors at both the protein expression and spatial transcriptomics  levels. Furthermore, drug sensitivity analysis revealed that the MaGPS signature  scores were significantly associated with the sensitivity to 38 different drugs,  highlighting potential targeted therapies related to MaGPS. CONCLUSION: The MaGPS model, based on bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and spatial  transcriptomics data, effectively evaluated the prognosis of pancreatic cancer  and provided valuable insights for better therapeutic targets.  © 2025 The Authors.

(#)Contributed equally  African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients exhibit a higher rate of  graft loss compared with other racial and ethnic populations, highlighting the  need to identify causative factors. Here, in the Genomics of Chronic Allograft  Rejection cohort, pretransplant blood RNA sequencing revealed a cluster of four  consecutive missense single-nucelotide polymorphisms (SNPs), within the  leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B3 (LILRB3) gene, strongly associated  with death-censored graft loss. This SNP cluster (named LILRB3-4SNPs) encodes  missense mutations at amino acids 617-618 proximal to a SHP1/2  phosphatase-binding immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The  LILRB3-4SNPs cluster is specifically enriched within AA individuals and  exhibited a strong association with death-censored graft loss and estimated  glomerular filtration rate decline in the AA participants from multiple  transplant cohorts. In two large Biobanks (BioMe and All-of-Us), the  LILRB3-4SNPs cluster was associated with the early onset of end-stage renal  disease and acted synergistically with the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) G1/G2  allele to accelerate disease progression. The SNPs were also linked to multiple  immune-related diseases in AA individuals. Last, on multiomics analysis of blood  and biopsies, recipients with LILRB3-4SNPs showed enhanced inflammation and  monocyte ferroptosis. While larger and prospective studies are needed, our data  provide insights on the genetic variation underlying kidney transplant outcomes.  © 2025.

Author information: (1)Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical  Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Apolipoprotein-L1 (APOL1) G1 and G2 risk variants, found in  people of recent west sub-Saharan African ancestry, dramatically increase the  likelihood of kidney disease, yet the incomplete penetrance an diverse clinical  manifestations underscore the need to understand the molecular and environmental  factors that modulate APOL1-mediated toxicity. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies confirm that risk variants exert a toxic  gain-of-function effect, exacerbated by inflammatory triggers such as HIV  infection and COVID-19. Epigenetic mechanisms and microRNA pathways further  modulate APOL1 expression, influencing disease penetrance. Multiple models have  clarified how subcellular localization, signal peptide processing, and  interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum may contribute to pathogenesis.  Therapeutic advances include inhibitors targeting APOL1 ion channel activity and  strategies that block key inflammatory signaling pathways. SUMMARY: These findings highlight a multifaceted disease process driven by both  the intrinsic toxic potential of APOL1 variants and numerous extrinsic triggers.  Understanding this complex interplay will be pivotal for risk stratification and  the development of precision therapies, potentially improving outcomes for  populations disproportionately affected by APOL1-associated kidney disease.

Renal risk variants in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene confer protection  against trypanosomiasis, but these risk variants (G1 and G2 variants) also  predispose to kidney disease among individuals, especially from  Sub-SaharanAfrica. Currently, the mechanisms of how these renal risk variants  induce kidney damage are not precisely defined, but lysosomal and mitochondrial  dysfunction, altered ion channel activity, altered autophagy, and disordered  immunity are suggested. Currently, there is no specific treatment for APOL1  kidney disease (APOL1-KD) although several potential disease-specific  therapeutic agents are being evaluated in clinical trials. Non-specific  interventions include proteinuria screening, salt restriction, and  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition but are not sufficient to  prevent kidney disease progression in APOL1-KD. Given the lack of specific  treatment options, more efforts are necessary to reduce kidney disease  progression. Sodium glucose co-transport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) are  gaining attention for benefits in proteinuric kidney diseases and exert many  beneficial effects which theoretically may be beneficial in the context of  APOL1-KD. These beneficial effects include but are not limited to increased  natriuresis, decreased proteinuria/albuminuria, and mitochondrial dysfunction.  SGLT2i have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. In the  current review, we highlight the potential reasons for exploring the use of  SGLT2i in APOL1-KD. Future studies are warranted to explore if SGLT2i use can  provide protection in APOL1-KD.  © 2025. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

The G1 and G2 variants of the APOL1 gene increase the risk of chronic kidney  disease (CKD) in individuals of African descent. In the presence of secondary  stressors such as inflammation and hypoxia, these gain-of-function variants can  induce podocyte dysfunction and cell death through mechanisms that are not fully  understood. To identify genes that influence the cytotoxic effects of APOL1  variants under hypoxic conditions, we conducted a comprehensive whole-genome RNA  interference (RNAi) screen. We found that silencing several peroxisomal (PEX)  genes significantly intensified the cytotoxicity associated with the G1 and G2  variants, revealing the previously unknown role of peroxisomes in APOL1-related  cytotoxicity. Importantly, enhancing peroxisomal function through both genetic  and pharmacological approaches led to a significant reduction in cytotoxicity  linked to these variants. We also identified a peroxisomal targeting signal at  the C-terminus of APOL1 that facilitates its translocation to peroxisomes during  hypoxia, and mutations in this signal were found to reduce the cytotoxic effects  of the variants.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health issue characterized by  progressive loss of kidney function, of which end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is  the last stage. The global increase in the prevalence of CKD is linked to the  increasing prevalence of traditional risk factors, including obesity,  hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, as well as metabolic factors, particularly  insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia. Mortality and  comorbidities, such as cardiovascular complications, rise steadily as kidney  function deteriorates. Patients who progress to ESKD require long-term kidney  replacement therapy, such as transplantation or hemodialysis/peritoneal  dialysis. It is currently understood that a crucial aspect of CKD involves  persistent, low-grade inflammation. In addition, increased oxidative and  metabolic stress, endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification from poor  calcium and phosphate metabolism, and difficulties with coagulation are some of  the complex molecular pathways underlying CKD-related and ESKD-related issues.  Novel mechanisms, such as microbiome dysbiosis and apolipoprotein L1 gene  mutation, have improved our understanding of kidney disease mechanisms. High  kidney disease risk of Africa has been linked to APOL1 high-risk alleles. The  3-fold increased risk of ESKD in African Americans compared to European  Americans is currently mainly attributed to variants in the APOL1 gene in the  chromosome 22q12 locus. Additionally, the role of new therapies such as SGLT2  inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and APOL1 channel function  inhibitors offers new therapeutic targets in slowing down the progression of  chronic kidney disease. This review describes recent molecular mechanisms  underlying CKD and emerging therapeutic targets.  Copyright © 2025 Boima, Agyekum, Ganatra, Agyekum, Kwakyi, Inusah, Ametefe and  Adu.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity,  affecting 3-6% of pregnancies worldwide and ranking among the top six causes of  maternal deaths in the U.S. PE typically develops after 20 weeks of gestation  and is characterized by new-onset hypertension and/or end-organ dysfunction,  with or without proteinuria. Current management strategies for PE emphasize  early diagnosis, blood pressure control, and timely delivery. For prevention,  low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) is recommended for high-risk women between 12 and  28 weeks of gestation. Magnesium sulfate is also advised to prevent seizures in  preeclamptic women at risk of eclampsia. Emerging management approaches include  antiangiogenic therapies, hypoxia-inducible factor suppression, statins, and  supplementation with CoQ10, nitric oxide, and hydrogen sulfide donors. Black  women are at particularly high risk for PE, potentially due to higher rates of  hypertension and cholesterol, compounded by healthcare disparities and possible  genetic factors, such as the APOL1 gene. This review explores current and  emerging strategies for managing PE and addresses the underlying causes of  health disparities, offering potential solutions to improve outcomes.

APOL1 Renal Risk Variants (APOL1RRVs, G1, and G2) are known to be toxic to  glomerular podocytes and causally associated with an enhanced prevalence and  progression of many different etiologies of chronic kidney disease (CKD),  leading to the delineation of a new disease designation of APOL1-Mediated Kidney  Disease (AMKD). Notably, APOL1RRVs have not consistently been shown to increase  the prevalence or severity of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression, which  is the most common cause of End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD). While this apparent  discrepancy seems perplexing, its clarification should provide important  mechanistic and therapeutic insights. Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System  (RAS) plays a critical role in the development and progression of DKD. Recent in  vitro and in vivo studies also demonstrated that RAS activation contributes to  kidney cell injury in AMKD experimental models. Both high glucose, as well as  APOL1RRVs escalate the podocyte expression of miR193a, a known mediator of  glomerulosclerosis, including idiopathic Focal Segmental Glomerular Sclerosis  (FSGS) and DKD. We propose that either the RAS and/or miR193a levels in the  diabetic milieu are already maximally conducive to kidney target cell injury  and, therefore, are agnostic to further injury in response to APOL1RRVs.  Similarly, the contributory role of hypertension (which is frequently reported  as the second most common cause of ESKD) in the progression of AMKD remains a  controversial issue. Since several clinical reports have shown that controlling  hypertension does not consistently slow the progression of AMKD, this has led to  a formulation wherein APOL1-RRVs primarily lead to kidney injury with  accompanying hypertension. Notably, half a decade later, the notion that  hypertension is not a cause but rather a consequence of kidney injury was  contested by investigators analyzing the Mount Sinai BioMe repository, a  comprehensive clinical and genetic database including participants with  APOL1RRVs. These investigators observed that hypertension predated the observed  decline in GFR in individuals with APOL1RRVs by ten years. In the present study,  we discuss the mechanistic forces that may underpin the gaps in these clinical  manifestations, which did not allow the temporal association of hypertension  with AMKD to be translated into causation and may also dissociate DKD and AMKD.  We have hypothesized models that need to be validated in future experimental  studies.

Platform-dependent effects of genetic variants on plasma APOL1 and their  implications for kidney disease.  Wang QS, Huang J, Chan L, Haste N, Olsson N, Gaun A, McAllister F, Madhireddy D,  Baruch A, Melamud E, Baryshnikova A.  Mutations in apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) are strongly associated with an increased  risk of kidney disease in individuals of African ancestry, yet the underlying  mechanisms remain largely unknown. Plasma proteomics provides opportunities to  elucidate mechanisms of disease by studying the effects of disease-associated  variants on circulating protein levels. Here, we examine the genetic drivers of  circulating APOL1 in individuals of African and European ancestry from four  independent cohorts (UK Biobank, AASK, deCODE and Health ABC) employing three  proteomic technologies (Olink, SomaLogic and mass spectrometry). We find that  disease-associated APOL1 G1 and G2 variants are strong pQTLs for plasma APOL1 in  Olink and SomaLogic, but the direction of their effects depends on the proteomic  platform. We identify an additional APOL1 missense variant (rs2239785), common  in Europeans, exhibiting the same platform-dependent directional discrepancy.  Similarly, variants in the kallikrein-kinin pathway ( KLKB1 , F12 , KNG1 ) and  their genetic interactions exhibit strong trans -pQTL effects for APOL1 measured  by Olink, but not SomaLogic. To explain these discrepancies, we propose a model  in which APOL1 mutations and the kallikrein-kinin pathway influence the relative  abundance of two distinct APOL1 forms, corresponding to APOL1 bound to  trypanolytic factors 1 and 2, which are differentially recognized by different  proteomic platforms. We hypothesize that this shift in relative abundance of  APOL1 forms may contribute to the development of kidney disease.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: The two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) variants, G1 and  G2, are common in populations of sub-Saharan African ancestry. Individuals with  two of these alleles (G1 or G2) have an increased risk for a spectrum of  non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases. However, these variants are typically not  observed outside of populations that self-identify as current continental  Africans or having clear recent African ancestry such as, most notably, African  Americans, and other large population groups in the Americas and several  European countries. We hypothesized that the diverse ethnic groups within the  Israeli population may exhibit varying levels of recent African ancestry.  Therefore, it is plausible that APOL1 risk alleles might be present even in  individuals who do not self-identify as being of sub-Saharan African descent. METHODS: We non-selectively screened people with kidney failure across Israel  for APOL1 risk variants using restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: We recruited 1744 individuals from 38 dialysis units in Israel. We  identified eight patients of Moroccan Jewish, Bedouin, or Muslim Arab ancestry,  who carry at least one G1 or G2 allele. None of the eight patients carried the  protective APOL1 p.N264K variant. Furthermore, despite all Bedouin individuals  being G2 heterozygous, the G2 minor allele frequency was significantly enriched  in kidney failure cases compared to ethnically matched controls (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that APOL1 G1 and G2 allelic variants are  present in populations previously not appreciated to possess recent sub-Saharan  ancestry and suggest that a single G2 risk variant may confer increased risk for  chronic kidney disease in certain population contexts.  © The Author(s) 2024.

BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia and preterm birth disproportionally affects Black  women, but the current understanding of genetic predisposition to preeclampsia  and preterm birth is rudimentary. It has been hypothesized that carriers of  high-risk genetic variants in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) may have an  increased risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth. These genetic variants are  found only among individuals of recent African ancestry. Previous studies have  been small and have yielded inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether APOL1 genetic variants are associated with risk of  preeclampsia or preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of 6616 Black  women from the Black Women's Health Study, a cohort of self-identified Black  women in the U.S. Genotype data on APOL1 risk alleles for this case control  study were obtained through new genotyping and existing genetic data from a  prior case control study of breast cancer using the Illumina Infinium Global  Diversity Array or Multi Ethnic Genotyping Array. Primary analyses evaluated  risk based on a recessive model, comparing women who carried two APOL1 risk  alleles to women who carried zero or one risk allele. We used multivariable  logistic regression models to examine associations among 1473 participants with  a history of preeclampsia (cases) and 5143 parous women who had not experienced  preeclampsia (controls), and among 1296 participants who had a history of  preterm birth and 5320 without such history. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) of preeclampsia for two APOL1 risk alleles vs. zero  or one risk allele was 0.99 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.74, 1.32) after  adjustment for principal components, genotype platform, and age in 1995. For  preterm birth, the comparable multivariable OR was 1.04 (95 % CI: 0.86, 1.25). CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective study from a general population of Black  women found no evidence of an association of APOL1 genotype with risk of either  preeclampsia or preterm birth.  © 2025 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies have showed a strong association between  bioavailable testosterone (BT) and breast cancer. However, the role of genetic  factors in their comorbidity remains unknown. METHODS: Using large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we employed  linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to identify the breast cancer  subtype most genetically correlated with BT. We then constructed the shared  genetic architecture between BT and this subtype by: (1) applied Heritability  Estimation from Summary Statistics for local genetic correlations and  stratified-LDSC for partitioned heritability; (2) performed a cross-trait GWAS  meta-analysis to find novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and validated  through colocalization; (3) conducted both cross-tissue and single-tissue  transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and validated the candidate genes  through Mendelian randomization (MR); (4) investigated SNP-heritability  enrichment at the gene set, tissue, and cell levels using Multi-marker Analysis  of GenoMic Annotation. RESULTS: Luminal A breast cancer (Luminal ABC) was selected as it is a common  subtype of breast cancer and demonstrates a superior genetic correlation with  BT. We identified strong local correlations in 132 distinct genomic regions and  confirmed shared SNPs including rs1432679 and rs7175852. TWAS highlighted two  pleiotropic genes, MICALL1 and TRIOBP, with TRIOBP validated by MR. We also  found six shared pathways and luminal cells in mammary gland pregnancy shared  between BT and Luminal ABC. For tissue-specific enrichment, BT was mainly found  in the liver and adrenal gland, whereas Luminal ABC was found in the minor  salivary gland. CONCLUSIONS: This study sheds light on the genetic architecture of BT and  Luminal ABC and suggests new avenues for research and therapy.  © 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: During mammalian spermatogenesis, the cytoskeleton system plays a  significant role in morphological changes. Male infertility such as  non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) might be explained by studies of the  cytoskeletal system during spermatogenesis. METHODS: The cytoskeleton, scaffold, and actin-binding genes were analyzed by  microarray and bioinformatics (771 spermatogenic cellsgenes and 774 Sertoli cell  genes). To validate these findings, we cross-referenced our results with data  from a single-cell genomics database. RESULTS: In the microarray analyses of three human cases with different NOA  spermatogenic cells, the expression of TBL3, MAGEA8, KRTAP3-2, KRT35, VCAN,  MYO19, FBLN2, SH3RF1, ACTR3B, STRC, THBS4, and CTNND2 were upregulated, while  expression of NTN1, ITGA1, GJB1, CAPZA1, SEPTIN8, and GOLGA6L6 were  downregulated. There was an increase in KIRREL3, TTLL9, GJA1, ASB1, and RGPD5  expression in the Sertoli cells of three human cases with NOA, whereas  expression of DES, EPB41L2, KCTD13, KLHL8, TRIOBP, ECM2, DVL3, ARMC10, KIF23,  SNX4, KLHL12, PACSIN2, ANLN, WDR90, STMN1, CYTSA, and LTBP3 were downregulated.  A combined analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and STRING, were used to predict  proteins' molecular interactions and then to recognize master pathways.  Functional enrichment analysis showed that the biological process (BP) mitotic  cytokinesis, cytoskeleton-dependent cytokinesis, and positive regulation of  cell-substrate adhesion were significantly associated with differentially  expressed genes (DEGs) in spermatogenic cells. Moleculare function (MF) of DEGs  that were up/down regulated, it was found that tubulin bindings, gap junction  channels, and tripeptide transmembrane transport were more significant in our  analysis. An analysis of GO enrichment findings of Sertoli cells showed BP and  MF to be common DEGs. Cell-cell junction assembly, cell-matrix adhesion, and  regulation of SNARE complex assembly were significantly correlated with common  DEGs for BP. In the study of MF, U3 snoRNA binding, and cadherin binding were  significantly associated with common DEGs. CONCLUSION: Our analysis, leveraging single-cell data, substantiated our  findings, demonstrating significant alterations in gene expression patterns.  © 2025. The Author(s).

We  obtained two independent glioma datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus  database, processed and normalized them using R software, and evaluated the  relationship between differentially expressed genes and glioma by differential  expression, expression quantitative trait loci, and Mendelian randomization (MR)  analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis and immunocytometric analysis further  explored the biological functions and pathways of identified genes, which were  validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression datasets.  We identified eight co-expressed genes-C1QB, GPX3, LRRC8B, TRIOBP, SNAPC5, SPI1,  TSPYL5, and FBXL16-that are crucial in various biological processes. CIBERSORT  analysis revealed significant immune cell-type distributions within gliomas,  underscoring the significance of immune cell infiltration. Validation in  additional datasets confirmed the MR analysis results and upstream regulatory  factors were identified using NetworkAnalyst. Our findings offer fresh  perspectives on the molecular underpinnings of glioma and highlight potential  targets for therapeutic interventions.  © 2025. The Author(s).

(2)Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Affiliated Hospital  of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, P.R. China.  RATIONALE: Through family investigation, the genetic map was drawn and  audiological characteristics were analyzed. High-throughput sequencing was used  to screen the deafness genes of the proband. Sanger sequencing was used to  verify the suspected pathogenic sites in the family. PATIENT CONCERNS: Identify the causes of hearing loss and treatment options. DIAGNOSES: Bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural deafness. INTERVENTIONS: After completing the examination, the patient was recommended to  wear a hearing aid or do a cochlear implant, but the patient was not treated for  personal reasons. OUTCOMES: All 8 patients in this family were nonsyndromic deafness. The proband  had a compound heterozygous mutation of c.A4484T/c.A4510G in the TRIOBP gene,  and the patient II-6 had a heterozygous mutation of c.A4484T in the TRIOBP gene.  A complex heterozygous mutation of TRIOBP gene c.A4510G/c.G59T was found in  II-7, but no reports of pathogenicity of these mutations were found in relevant  literatures and databases. In addition, patients II-6, III-4, and III-6 had  heterozygous mutations of CHD7 gene c.T2615C and C.3202-5T >C, and patients II-6  and III-4 also had heterozygous mutations of CHD23 gene c.G5312A and c.C6250T. LESSONS: In this study, a new locus of the TRIOBP gene was found, which enriched  the gene mutant spectrum and clarified the pathogenic gene of the proband.  However, the etiology of deafness in other members of the family needs to be  further analyzed.  Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Hearing loss (HL) is the most prevalent sensorineural disorders, affecting about  one in 1000 newborns. Over half of the cases are attributed to genetic factors;  however, due to the extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity, many cases  remain without a conclusive genetic diagnosis. The advent of next-generation  sequencing methodologies in recent years has greatly helped unravel the genetic  etiology of HL by identifying numerous genes and causative variants. Despite  this, much remains to be uncovered about the genetic basis of sensorineural  hearing loss (SNHL). Here, we report an Iranian consanguineous family with  postlingual, moderate-to-severe autosomal recessive SNHL. After first excluding  plausible variants in known deafness-causing genes using whole exome sequencing,  we reanalyzed the data, using a gene/variant prioritization pipeline established  for novel gene discovery for HL. This approach identified a novel homozygous  frameshift variant c.1934_1937del; (p.Thr645Lysfs*52) in ANKRD24, which  segregated with the HL phenotype in the family. Recently, ANKRD24 has been shown  to be a pivotal constituent of the stereocilia rootlet in cochlea hair cells and  interacts with TRIOBP, a protein already implicated in human deafness. Our data  implicate for the first time, ANKRD24 in human nonsyndromic HL (NSHL) and  expands the genetic spectrum of HL.  © 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness-28 (DFNB28; OMIM #609823)  specifically refers to prelingual sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) resulting  from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIO- and  F-actin-binding protein, TRIOBP gene. In this report, we present a pediatric  patient exhibiting novel compound heterozygous deleterious variants in the  TRIOBP gene. METHODS: The auditory brainstem response result revealed both left- and  right-sided deafness with a threshold of 20 dB normal hearing level in the  proband. A comprehensive trio whole exome sequencing (WES) using the Celemics  G-Mendeliome Whole Exome Sequencing Panel was employed. RESULTS: The WES analysis revealed compound heterozygous TRIOBP variants in the  proband, namely c.1192_1195delCAACinsT/p.Gln398* classified as pathogenic and  c.3661C > T/p.Arg1221Trp categorized as a variant of uncertain significance  according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. These  variants are considered the most probable cause of the proband's SNHL. CONCLUSION: TRIOBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the inner ear,  contributing to the formation of stereocilia rootlets. Further investigations  are required to fully understand the phenotypic variability and establish the  pathogenicity of the identified variant in relation to the TRIOBP gene and SNHL.  © 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Ménière's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear that causes  episodic bouts of severe dizziness, roaring tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing  loss. To date, no targeted therapy exists. As such, we have undertaken a large  whole genome sequencing study on carefully phenotyped unilateral MD patients  with the goal of gene/pathway discovery and a move towards targeted  intervention. This study was a retrospective review of patients with a history  of Ménière's disease. Genomic DNA, acquired from saliva samples, was purified  and subjected to whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: Stringent variant calling, performed on 511 samples passing quality  checks, followed by gene-based filtering by recurrence and proximity in  molecular interaction networks, led to 481 high priority MD genes. These high  priority genes, including MPHOSPH8, MYO18A, TRIOBP, OTOGL, TNC, and MYO6, were  previously implicated in hearing loss, balance, and cochlear function, and were  significantly enriched in common variant studies of hearing loss. Validation in  an independent MD cohort confirmed 82 recurrent genes. Pathway analysis pointed  to cell-cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and cellular energy maintenance as  key mediators of MD. Furthermore, the MD-prioritized genes were highly expressed  in human inner ear hair cells and dark/vestibular cells, and were differentially  expressed in a mouse model of hearing loss. CONCLUSION: By enabling the development of model systems that may lead to  targeted therapies and MD screening panels, the genes and variants identified in  this study will inform diagnosis and treatment of MD.  © 2024.

The co-occurrence of sensorineural hearing loss and male infertility has been  reported in several instances, suggesting potential shared genetic  underpinnings. One such example is the contiguous gene deletion of CATSPER2 and  STRC genes, previously associated with deafness-infertility syndrome (DIS) in  males. Fifteen males with both hearing loss and infertility from southern India  after exclusion for the DIS contiguous gene deletion and the FOXI1 gene  mutations are subjected to exome sequencing. This resolves the genetic etiology  in four probands for both the phenotypes; In the remaining 11 probands, two each  conclusively accounted for deafness and male infertility etiologies. Genetic  heterogeneity is well reflected in both phenotypes. Four recessive (TRIOBP,  SLC26A4, GJB2, COL4A3) and one dominant (SOX10) for the deafness; six recessive  genes (LRGUK, DNAH9, ARMC4, DNAH2, RSPH6A, and ACE) for male infertility can be  conclusively ascribed. LRGUK and RSPH6A genes are implicated earlier only in  mice models, while the ARMC4 gene is implicated in chronic destructive airway  diseases due to primary ciliary dyskinesia. This study would be the first to  document the role of these genes in the male infertility phenotype in humans.  The result suggests that deafness and infertility are independent events and do  not segregate together among the probands.  © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Genetics published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

INTRODUCTION: Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness  globally. Characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell degeneration, the  precise pathogenesis remains unknown. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)  have uncovered many genetic variants associated with elevated intraocular  pressure (IOP), one of the key risk factors for POAG. We aimed to identify  genetic and morphological variation that can be attributed to trabecular  meshwork cell (TMC) dysfunction and raised IOP in POAG. METHODS: 62 genes across 55 loci were knocked-out in a primary human TMC line.  Each knockout group, including five non-targeting control groups, underwent  single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) for differentially-expressed gene (DEG)  analysis. Multiplexed fluorescence coupled with CellProfiler image analysis  allowed for single-cell morphological profiling. RESULTS: Many gene knockouts invoked DEGs relating to matrix metalloproteinases  and interferon-induced proteins. We have prioritized genes at four loci of  interest to identify gene knockouts that may contribute to the pathogenesis of  POAG, including ANGPTL2, LMX1B, CAV1, and KREMEN1. Three genetic networks of  gene knockouts with similar transcriptomic profiles were identified, suggesting  a synergistic function in trabecular meshwork cell physiology. TEK knockout  caused significant upregulation of nuclear granularity on morphological  analysis, while knockout of TRIOBP, TMCO1 and PLEKHA7 increased granularity and  intensity of actin and the cell-membrane. CONCLUSION: High-throughput analysis of cellular structure and function through  multiplex fluorescent single-cell analysis and scRNA-seq assays enabled the  direct study of genetic perturbations at the single-cell resolution. This work  provides a framework for investigating the role of genes in the pathogenesis of  glaucoma and heterogenous diseases with a strong genetic basis.  © The Author(s) 2024.

BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma has several subtypes, with kidney renal clear  cell carcinoma (KIRC) being the most common and heterogeneous. Purine metabolism  is associated with cancer progression. However, the role of purine  metabolism-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in KIRC remains unknown. METHODS: KIRC were grouped into Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 based on purine genes.  Limma package was used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between two  classes of purine genes. Single-factor screening was used followed by random  forest dimensionality reduction and Lasso method to screen lncRNAs. A risk score  model (Purine Score) containing the 3 lncRNAs was developed using the Lasso  method. RESULTS: A total of 22 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified. These  were reduced to a final set of three (LINC01671, ARAP1-AS1 and LINC02747). Age  and metastasis (M) were identified as independent prognostic factors for KIRC  using univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. An abnormal immune cell response  was also associated with patient survival. The Purine Score correlated with  abnormal expression of immune checkpoint genes. Genetic analysis of KIRC found  somatic mutations in TP53, TRIOBP, PBRM1, PKHD1, VHL, NPHP3, TLN2, CABIN1,  ABCC6, XIRP2, and CHD4. In vitro cell experiments showed that knockdown of  LINC01671 promoted the proliferation and migration of 786-O cells, while  inhibiting apoptosis. Overexpression of LINC01671 inhibited the proliferation  and migration of CAKI-1 cells, while promoting apoptosis. Gene Set Enrichment  Analysis (GSEA) analysis revealed that LINC01671 was significantly enriched in  the MAPK, NF-kappa B, mTOR, PI3K-Akt, and Wnt signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: LINC01671 may be a novel prognostic marker with important  therapeutic value for KIRC.  © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IMR Press.

(#)Contributed equally  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and devastating lung disease of  unknown etiology, described as the result of multiple cycles of epithelial cell  injury and fibroblast activation. Despite this impressive increase in  understanding, a therapy that reverses this form of fibrosis remains elusive. In  our previous study, we found that miR-29b has a therapeutic effect on pulmonary  fibrosis. However, its anti-fibrotic mechanism is not yet clear. Recently, our  study identified that F-Actin Binding Protein (TRIOBP) is one of the target  genes of miR-29b and found that deficiency of TRIOBP increases resistance to  lung fibrosis in vivo. TRIOBP knockdown inhibited the proliferation of  epithelial cells and attenuated the activation of fibroblasts. In addition,  deficiency of Trio Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (TRIO) in epithelial  cells and fibroblasts decreases susceptibility to lung fibrosis. TRIOBP  interacting with TRIO promoted abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk and  modulated the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of β-catenin. We concluded that  the miR-29b‒TRIOBP-TRIO-β-catenin axis might be a key anti-fibrotic axis in IPF  to regulate lung regeneration and fibrosis, which may provide a promising  treatment strategy for lung fibrosis.  © 2023.

Aggregation of Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 arises from a central region of the  protein.  Zaharija B(1), Bradshaw NJ(2).  Author information: (1)Faculty of Biotechnology and Drug Development, University of Rijeka, Croatia. (2)Faculty of Biotechnology and Drug Development, University of Rijeka, Croatia.  Electronic address: nicholas.b@biotech.uniri.hr.  An emerging approach to studying major mental illness is through proteostasis,  with the identification of several proteins that form insoluble aggregates in  the brains of patients. One of these is Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a  neurodevelopmentally-important scaffold protein, and product of a classic  schizophrenia risk gene. DISC1 aggregates have been detected in post mortem  brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major  depressive disorder, as well as various model systems, although the mechanism by  which it aggregates is still unclear. Aggregation of two other proteins  implicated in mental illness, TRIOBP-1 and NPAS3, was shown to be dependent on  very specific structural regions of the protein. We therefore looked at the  domain structure of DISC1, and investigated which structural elements are key  for its aggregation. While none of the known structured DISC1 regions (named D,  I, S and C respectively) formed aggregates individually when expressed in  neuroblastoma cells, the combination of the D and I regions, plus the linker  region between them, formed visible aggregates. Further refinement revealed that  a region of approximately 30 amino acids between these two regions is critical  for aggregation, and deletion of this region is sufficient to abolish the  aggregation propensity of DISC1. This finding from mammalian cell culture  contrasts with the recent determination that the C-region of DISC1 can aggregate  in vitro, although some variations of the C-terminal of DISC1 could aggregate in  our system. It therefore appears likely that DISC1 aggregation, implicated in  mental illness, can occur through at least two distinct mechanisms.  Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Nanoinjection-the process of intracellular delivery using vertically  configured nanostructures-is a physical route that efficiently negotiates the  plasma membrane, with minimal perturbation and toxicity to the cells.  Nanoinjection, as a physical membrane-disruption-mediated approach, overcomes  challenges associated with conventional carrier-mediated approaches such as  safety issues (with viral carriers), genotoxicity, limited packaging capacity,  low levels of endosomal escape, and poor versatility for cell and cargo types.  Yet, despite the implementation of nanoinjection tools and their assisted  analogues in diverse cellular manipulations, there are still substantial  challenges in harnessing these platforms to gain access into cell interiors with  much greater precision without damaging the cell's intricate structure. Here, we  propose a non-viral, low-voltage, and reusable electroactive nanoinjection (ENI)  platform based on vertically configured conductive nanotubes (NTs) that allows  for rapid influx of targeted biomolecular cargos into the intracellular  environment, and for successful gene silencing. The localization of electric  fields at the tight interface between conductive NTs and the cell membrane  drastically lowers the voltage required for cargo delivery into the cells, from  kilovolts (for bulk electroporation) to only ≤ 10 V; this enhances the fine  control over membrane disruption and mitigates the problem of high cell  mortality experienced by conventional electroporation. RESULTS: Through both theoretical simulations and experiments, we demonstrate  the capability of the ENI platform to locally perforate GPE-86 mouse fibroblast  cells and efficiently inject a diverse range of membrane-impermeable  biomolecules with efficacy of 62.5% (antibody), 55.5% (mRNA), and 51.8% (plasmid  DNA), with minimal impact on cells' viability post nanoscale-EP (> 90%). We also  show gene silencing through the delivery of siRNA that targets TRIOBP, yielding  gene knockdown efficiency of 41.3%. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that our non-viral and low-voltage ENI platform is  set to offer a new safe path to intracellular delivery with broader selection of  cargo and cell types, and will open opportunities for advanced ex vivo cell  engineering and gene silencing.  © 2023.

There has been a growing interest in the role of the subchondral bone and its  resident osteoclasts in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). A recent  genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 100 independent association  signals for OA traits. Most of these signals are led by noncoding variants,  suggesting that genetic regulatory effects may drive many of the associations.  We have generated a unique human osteoclast-like cell-specific expression  quantitative trait locus (eQTL) resource for studying the genetics of bone  disease. Considering the potential role of osteoclasts in the pathogenesis of  OA, we performed an integrative analysis of this dataset with the recently  published OA GWAS results. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and  colocalization analyses identified 38 genes with a potential role in OA,  including some that have been implicated in Mendelian diseases with  joint/skeletal abnormalities, such as BICRA, EIF6, CHST3, and FBN2. Several OA  GWAS signals demonstrated colocalization with more than one eQTL peak, including  at 19q13.32 (hip OA with BCAM, PRKD2, and BICRA eQTL). We also identified a  number of eQTL signals colocalizing with more than one OA trait, including  FAM53A, GCAT, HMGN1, MGAT4A, RRP7BP, and TRIOBP. An SMR analysis identified 3  loci with evidence of pleiotropic effects on OA-risk and gene expression:  LINC01481, CPNE1, and EIF6. Both CPNE1 and EIF6 are located at 20q11.22, a locus  harboring 2 other strong OA candidate genes, GDF5 and UQCC1, suggesting the  presence of an OA-risk gene cluster. In summary, we have used our  osteoclast-specific eQTL dataset to identify genes potentially involved with the  pathogenesis of OA.  © The Author(s) 2023.

(2)Human Brain Tissue Bank & Laboratory, Semmelweis University, 1094 Budapest,  Hungary.  BACKGROUND: Disrupted proteostasis is an emerging area of research into major  depressive disorder. Several proteins have been implicated as forming aggregates  specifically in the brains of subsets of patients with psychiatric illnesses.  These proteins include CRMP1, DISC1, NPAS3 and TRIOBP-1. It is unclear, however,  whether these proteins normally aggregate together in the same individuals and,  if so, whether each protein aggregates independently of each other (""parallel  aggregation"") or if the proteins physically interact and aggregate together  (""co-aggregation""). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Post mortem insular cortex samples from major depressive  disorder and Alzheimer's disease patients, suicide victims and control  individuals had their insoluble fractions isolated and tested by Western  blotting to determine which of these proteins are insoluble and, therefore,  likely to be aggregating. The ability of the proteins to co-aggregate (directly  interact and form common aggregate structures) was tested by systematic pairwise  expression of the proteins in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which were then  examined by immunofluorescent microscopy. RESULTS: Many individuals displayed multiple insoluble proteins in the brain,  although not enough to imply interaction between the proteins. Cell culture  analysis revealed that only a few of the proteins analyzed can consistently  co-aggregate with each other: DISC1 with each of CRMP1 and TRIOBP-1. DISC1 was  able to induce aggregation of full length TRIOBP-1, but not individual domains  of TRIOBP-1 when they were expressed individually. CONCLUSIONS: While specific proteins are capable of co-aggregating, and appear  to do so in the brains of individuals with mental illness and potentially also  with suicidal tendency, it is more common for such proteins to aggregate in a  parallel manner, through independent mechanisms. This information aids in  understanding the distribution of protein aggregates among mental illness  patients and is therefore important for any future diagnostic or therapeutic  approaches based on this aspect of mental illness pathology.

SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS WITH NPAS3, DYSBINDIN-1 AND/OR TRIOBP  PROTEIN PATHOLOGY IN THEIR BLOOD SERUM: A PANSS-BASED FOLLOW UP STUDY.

BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that aggregation of specific proteins in the  brain may be a pathological element in schizophrenia and other chronic  disorders. Multiple such aggregating proteins have now been implicated through  post mortem investigation, including NPAS3 (Neuronal PAS domain protein 3),  dysbindin-1 (encoded by the DTNBP1, Dystrobrevin Binding Protein 1, gene) and  TRIOBP (Trio-Binding Protein, multiple isoforms). While the presence of protein  aggregates in the brain is interesting in terms of understanding pathology, it  is impractical as a biomarker. These proteins were therefore investigated  recently in blood serum of schizophrenia patients and controls, showing patients  to have higher levels of NPAS3 in their serum generally. TRIOBP-1 and  dysbindin-1 were also found in an insoluble state, implying aggregation, but did  not clearly corresponding to disease state. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We revisit 47 of the originally recruited 50 patients with  schizophrenia, all of whom are Croatian and aged between 18 and 72. We assessed  their symptom specificity and severity using PANSS (the Positive and Negative  Symptoms Scale), comparing those with NPAS3, insoluble dysbindin-1 and/or  insoluble TRIOBP-1 in their blood serum to those lacking any such protein  dysregulation. RESULTS: The frequency of each individual potential protein pathology among  these patients was too low for meaningful statistical analysis, however the 11  patients that displayed one or more of these pathologies (NPAS3, dysbindin-1,  TRIOBP-1 and/or TRIOBP-5/6) showed a subtle but significant increase in total  PANSS scores compared to the 36 patients displaying none of the pathologies (p =  0.031), seemingly driven principally by increased scores on the general  psychopathology scale. CONCLUSION: While the numbers of patients involved do not allow firm conclusions  to be drawn at this time, this provides the first indication that disturbed  proteostasis in blood serum, of proteins that aggregate in the brains of  schizophrenia patients, may correlate with the severity of schizophrenia  symptoms.

Mental disorders represent common brain diseases characterized by substantial  impairments of social and cognitive functions. The neurobiological causes and  mechanisms of psychopathologies still have not been definitively determined.  Various forms of brain proteinopathies, which include a disruption of protein  conformations and the formation of protein aggregates in brain tissues, may be a  possible cause behind the development of psychiatric disorders. Proteinopathies  are known to be the main cause of neurodegeneration, but much less attention is  given to the role of protein impairments in psychiatric disorders' pathogenesis,  such as depression and schizophrenia. For this reason, the aim of this review  was to discuss the potential contribution of protein illnesses in the  development of psychopathologies. The first part of the review describes the  possible mechanisms of disruption to protein folding and aggregation in the  cell: endoplasmic reticulum stress, dysfunction of chaperone proteins, altered  mitochondrial function, and impaired autophagy processes. The second part of the  review addresses the known proteins whose aggregation in brain tissue has been  observed in psychiatric disorders (amyloid, tau protein, α-synuclein, DISC-1,  disbindin-1, CRMP1, SNAP25, TRIOBP, NPAS3, GluA1, FABP, and ankyrin-G).

Electronic address:  fzhxjtu@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.  BACKGROUND: Comparing with the general population, the pain in depression  patients has more complex biological mechanism. We aim to explore the  etiological mechanism of pain in depression patients from the perspective of  genetics. METHODS: Utilizing the UK Biobank samples with self-reported depression status  or PHQ score ≥10, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of seven  pain traits (N = 1,133-58,349). Additionally, we used FUSION pipeline to perform  proteome-wide association study (PWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study  (TWAS) by integrating GWAS summary data with two different proteome reference  weights (ROS/MAP and Banner) and Rnaseq gene expression reference weights,  respectively. RESULTS: GWAS identified 3 significant genes associated with different pain  traits in depression patients, including TRIOBP (PGWAS = 4.48 × 10-8) for  stomach or abdominal pain, SLC9A9(PGWAS = 2.77 × 10-8) for multisite chronic  pain (MCP) and ADGRF1 (PGWAS = 1.51 × 10-8) for neck or shoulder pain. In  addition, PWAS and TWAS analysis also identified multiple candidate genes  associated with different pain traits in depression patients, such as TPRG1L  (PPWAS-Banner = 3.38 × 10-2) and SIRPA (PPWAS-Banner = 3.65 × 10-2) for MCP,  etc. Notably, when comparing the results of PWAS and TWAS analysis, we found  overlapping candidate genes in these pain traits, such as GSTM3  (PPWAS-Banner = 3.38 × 10-2, PTWAS = 6.92 × 10-3) in the stomach or abdominal  pain phenotype, ATG7 (PPWAS-Rosmap = 3.15 × 10-2, PTWAS = 2.98 × 10-2) in the  MCP, etc. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple novel candidate genes for pain  traits in depression patients from different perspectives of genetics, which  provided novel clues for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying the  pain in depression patients.

Some proteins represent members of conserved families, meaning that their domain  structure can be easily predicted by comparison to homologous proteins whose  structures have been solved experimentally. Many other proteins, however, do not  share significant detectable homology with other proteins, often as results of  high amounts of coiled-coil structure and/or intrinsically unstructured regions.  These proteins include many whose aggregation is linked to human disease.Here we  present a refined and reliable workflow for identifying the domains of such  proteins, through cloning of multiple alternative fragments, and testing whether  they form soluble, folded structures when expressed as recombinant peptides in  E. coli, through the use of size exclusion chromatography. By using Gateway  recombination for cloning, these fragments can then be rapidly transferred to  alternate vectors for testing in mammalian cells. We then specifically  illustrate its use for proteins that form pathological aggregates in disease,  mapping not just their basic domain structures but also the specific subdomains  responsible for aggregation.  © 2023.

Spirostomum is a unicellular ciliate capable of contracting to a quarter of its  body length in less than five milliseconds. When measured as fractional  shortening, this is an order of magnitude faster than motion powered by  actomyosin. Myonemes, which are protein networks found near the cortex of many  protists, are believed to power Spirostomum contraction. Fast contraction, slow  elongation, and calcium-triggering are hallmarks of myoneme-based motion. The  biochemical basis of this motion and the molecular mechanism that supports such  fast speeds are not well understood. Previous work suggests that myoneme  structures in some protists are rich in centrin and Sfi1 homologs, two proteins  that may underlie contraction. Centrin undergoes a significant conformational  change in the presence of calcium, allowing it to bind to other centrin  molecules. To understand Spirostomum contraction, we measure changes in cortical  structures and model contraction of the whole cell and of the underlying protein  complexes. We provide evidence that centrin/Sfi1 structures are responsible for  contraction, which we propose is powered by a modulated entropic spring. Using  this model, we recapitulate organismal-scale contraction in mesh simulation  experiments and demonstrate the importance of structural organization of myoneme  in a fishnet-like structure. These results provide a cohesive, multiscale model  for the contraction of Spirostomum. Deeper understanding of how single cells can  execute extreme shape changes holds potential for advancing cell biophysics,  synthetically engineering contractile machinery, and cellular-inspired  engineering designs.

The Tibetan Plateau's distinctive high-altitude environment, marked by extreme  cold and reduced oxygen levels, presents considerable survival challenges for  both humans and mammals. Natural selection has led to the accumulation of  adaptive mutations in Tibetan pigs, enabling them to develop distinctive  adaptive phenotypes. Here, we aim to uncover the genetic mechanisms underlying  the adaptation of Tibetan pigs to high-altitude hypoxia. Therefore, we conducted  a systematic analysis of 140 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data points from  different representing pig populations. Our analysis identified a total of  27,614,561 mutations, including 22,386,319 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and  5,228,242 insertions/deletions (INDELs, size < 50 bp). A total of 11%  (2,678,569) of the SNVs were newly identified in our project, significantly  expanding the dataset of genetic variants in Tibetan pigs. Compared to other pig  breeds, Tibetan pigs are uniquely adapted to high-altitude environments,  exhibiting the highest genetic diversity and the lowest inbreeding coefficient.  Employing the composite of multiple signals (CMS) method, we scanned the  genome-wide Darwinian positive selection signals and identified 32,499 Tibetan  pig positively selected SNVs (TBPSSs) and 129 selected genes (TBPSGs), including  213 newly discovered genes. Notably, we identified eight genes (PHACTR1, SFI1,  EPM2A, SLC30A7, NKAIN2, TNNI3K, and PLIN2) with strong nature selection signals.  They are likely to improve cardiorespiratory function and fat metabolism to help  Tibetan pigs become adapted to the high-altitude environment. These findings  provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation and  the adaptive phenotypes of Tibetan pigs.

Author information: (1)Tuzla Devlet Hastanesi, Ortopedi ve Travmatoloji Kliniği, 34947 Tuzla,  İstanbul, Türkiye. tahirburaksaritas@gmail.com.  OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the histopathological, biochemical, and  functional effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective activity, on nerve regeneration in rats  with sciatic nerve crush (axonotmesis) injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used 16 male Wistar rats, which were divided  into treatment and control groups. A standard axonotmesis-type surgical injury  was induced in the left sciatic nerves of all rats. The treatment group was  given 300 mg/kg of intraperitoneal NAC once a day, whereas the control group  received an equal volume of saline solution. After conducting gait analyses, the  sciatic functional index (SFI) was used for functional assessment. After gait  analysis, all animals were euthanized. Blood samples were examined  biochemically. The left sciatic nerves and left triceps surae muscles were  examined histopathologically. RESULTS: Histopathologically, the thickness of the perineurium, axonal  degeneration, axonolysis, edema, inflammation, muscle atrophy, and muscle  degeneration were all significantly lower in the treatment group (p<0.05).  Functionally, SFI-1, SFI-2, and SFI-3 were significantly higher in the treatment  group (p<0.05). Biochemically, while the native thiol level and native  thiol/total thiol ratio were significantly higher in the treatment group  (p<0.003), the disulfide/total thiol ratio was significantly higher in the  control group (p<0.005). Significant correlations were found between six of the  seven gait parameters and the histopathological findings (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that NAC may contribute positively to the  histopathological and functional recovery of sciatic nerve injury in rats.  Furthermore, NAC may have an antioxidant effect on thiol-disulfide homeostasis  at a biochemical level. We believe that NAC has a stimulatory effect on healing  following nerve injuries.

Biogenesis and maintenance of centrioles with proper number, size, and  architecture are vital for their functions during development and physiology.  While centriole number control has been well-studied, less is understood about  their maintenance as stable structures with conserved size and architecture  during cell division and ciliary motility. Here, we identified CCDC15 as a  centriole protein that colocalizes with and interacts with the inner scaffold, a  crucial centriolar subcompartment for centriole size control and integrity.  Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we found that CCDC15 depletion  affects centriole length and integrity, leading to defective cilium formation,  maintenance, and response to Hedgehog signaling. Moreover, loss-of-function  experiments showed CCDC15's role in recruiting both the inner scaffold protein  POC1B and the distal SFI1/Centrin-2 complex to centrioles. Our findings reveal  players and mechanisms of centriole architectural integrity and insights into  diseases linked to centriolar defects.  © 2023 Arslanhan et al.

This study investigates the interaction between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)  and metabolic risk factors that contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD). A  total transcriptome high throughput sequencing study was conducted on peripheral  blood mononuclear cells from five patients with CAD and five healthy controls.  Validation assay by qRT-PCR was conducted among 270 patients and 47 controls.  Finally, to evaluate the lncRNAs' diagnostic value for CAD, the Spearman  correlation test and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were  utilized. Additionally, univariate and multivariate logistic regression along  with crossover analyses were conducted to identify the interaction between  lncRNA and environmental risk factors. A total of 2149 of 26,027 lncRNAs  identified by RNA sequencing were differentially expressed in CAD patients  compared to controls. Validation by qRT-PCR showed significantly different  relative expression levels for lncRNAs PDXDC1-AS1, SFI1-AS1, RP13-143G15.3,  DAPK1-IT1, PPIE-AS1, and RP11-362A1.1 between the two groups (all P<0.05). The  area under the ROC values of PDXDC1-AS1 and SFI1-AS1 is 0.645 (sensitivity=0.443  and specificity=0.920) and 0.629 (sensitivity=0.571 and specificity=0.909),  especially. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that lncRNAs  PDXDC1-AS1 (OR=2.285, 95%CI=1.390-3.754, p=0.001) and SFI1-AS1 (OR=1.163,  95%CI=1.163-2.264, p=0.004) were protective factors against CAD. Under the  additive model, cross-over analyses demonstrated significant interactions  between lncRNAs PDXDC1-AS1 and smoking in relation to CAD risk (S=3.871,  95%CI=1.140-6.599). PDXDC1-AS1 and SFI1-AS1 were sensitive and specific  biomarkers for CAD and exhibited synergistic effects with certain environmental  factors. These results highlighted their potential use as CAD diagnostic  biomarkers for future research.  © 2023.

Malaria-causing parasites achieve rapid proliferation in human blood through  multiple rounds of asynchronous nuclear division followed by daughter cell  formation. Nuclear divisions critically depend on the centriolar plaque, which  organizes intranuclear spindle microtubules. The centriolar plaque consists of  an extranuclear compartment, which is connected via a nuclear pore-like  structure to a chromatin-free intranuclear compartment. Composition and function  of this non-canonical centrosome remain largely elusive. Centrins, which reside  in the extranuclear part, are among the very few centrosomal proteins conserved  in Plasmodium falciparum. Here we identify a novel centrin-interacting  centriolar plaque protein. Conditional knock down of this Sfi1-like protein  (PfSlp) caused a growth delay in blood stages, which correlated with a reduced  number of daughter cells. Surprisingly, intranuclear tubulin abundance was  significantly increased, which raises the hypothesis that the centriolar plaque  might be implicated in regulating tubulin levels. Disruption of tubulin  homeostasis caused excess microtubules and aberrant mitotic spindles. Time-lapse  microscopy revealed that this prevented or delayed mitotic spindle extension but  did not significantly interfere with DNA replication. Our study thereby  identifies a novel extranuclear centriolar plaque factor and establishes a  functional link to the intranuclear compartment of this divergent eukaryotic  centrosome.

The eco-evolutionary history of penguins is characterised by shifting from  temperate to cold environments. Breeding in Antarctica, the Emperor penguin  appears as an extreme outcome of this process, with unique features related to  insulation, heat production and energy management. However, whether this species  actually diverged from a less cold-adapted ancestor, more ecologically similar  to its sister species, the King penguin, is still an open question. As the  Antarctic colonisation likely resulted in vast changes in selective pressure  experienced by the Emperor penguin, the relative quantification of the genomic  signatures of selection, unique to each sister species, could answer this  question. Applying phylogeny-based selection tests on 7651 orthologous genes, we  identified a more pervasive selection shift in the Emperor penguin than in the  King penguin, supporting the hypothesis that its extreme cold adaptation is a  derived state. Furthermore, among candidate genes under selection, four (TRPM8,  LEPR, CRB1, and SFI1) were identified before in other cold-adapted homeotherms,  like the woolly Mammoth, while other 161 genes can be assigned to biological  functions relevant to cold adaptation identified in previous studies. Location  and structural effects of TRPM8 substitutions in Emperor and King penguin  lineages support their functional role with putative divergent effects on  thermal adaptation. We conclude that extreme cold adaptation in the Emperor  penguin largely involved unique genetic options which, however, affect metabolic  and physiological traits common to other cold-adapted homeotherms.  © 2022.

(#)Contributed equally  Over the course of evolution, the centrosome function has been conserved in most  eukaryotes, but its core architecture has evolved differently in some clades,  with the presence of centrioles in humans and a spindle pole body (SPB) in  yeast. Similarly, the composition of these two core elements has diverged, with  the exception of Centrin and SFI1, which form a complex in yeast to initiate SPB  duplication. However, it remains unclear whether this complex exists at  centrioles and whether its function has been conserved. Here, using expansion  microscopy, we demonstrate that human SFI1 is a centriolar protein that  associates with a pool of Centrin at the distal end of the centriole. We also  find that both proteins are recruited early during procentriole assembly and  that depletion of SFI1 results in the loss of the distal pool of Centrin,  without altering centriole duplication. Instead, we show that SFI1/Centrin  complex is essential for centriolar architecture, CEP164 distribution, and CP110  removal during ciliogenesis. Together, our work reveals a conserved SFI1/Centrin  module displaying divergent functions between mammals and yeast.  © 2022 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY NC ND 4.0 license.

Author information: (1)Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona, Strada Le Grazie 15, 37134  Verona, Italy.  Centrins are calcium (Ca2+)-binding proteins that are involved in many cellular  functions including centrosome regulation. A known cellular target of centrins  is SFI1, a large centrosomal protein containing multiple repeats that represent  centrin-binding motifs. Recently, a protein homologous to yeast and mammalian  SFI1, denominated TgSFI1, which shares SFI1-repeat organization, was shown to  colocalize at centrosomes with centrin 1 from Toxoplasma gondii (TgCEN1).  However, the molecular details of the interaction between TgCEN1 and TgSFI1  remain largely unknown. Herein, combining different biophysical methods,  including isothermal titration calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, circular  dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy, we determined the binding properties  of TgCEN1 and its individual N- and C-terminal domains to synthetic peptides  derived from distinct repeats of TgSFI1. Overall, our data indicate that the  repeats in TgSFI1 constitute binding sites for TgCEN1, but the binding modes of  TgCEN1 to the repeats differ appreciably in terms of binding affinity, Ca2+  sensitivity, and lobe-specific interaction. These results suggest that TgCEN1  displays remarkable conformational plasticity, allowing for the distinct repeats  in TgSFI1 to possess precise modes of TgCEN1 binding and regulation during Ca2+  sensing, which appears to be crucial for the dynamic association of TgCEN1 with  TgSFI1 in the centrosome architecture.

Omics data  integration and processing from different and independent studies is achieved by  using efficient and effective computational tools through meta-analysis.  Meta-analysis is a statistical powerful tool combining data from numerous  studies, minimizes bias and increases statistical power by increasing sample  size compared to individual studies. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of  gene expression data in adipose tissue to identify genes that are differentially  expressed between obese and non-obese subjects as well as to detect gene  expression signatures, pathways and networks associated with obesity. We  identified 821 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adipose tissue of obese  subjects compared to non-obese. A protein-protein interactions (PPIs) network  was reconstructed consisting of 168 proteins. Functional enrichment analysis in  the network revealed proteins involved in RNA and energy metabolism. The KEGG  pathway analysis revealed 15 enriched pathway terms. Furthermore, multiple  testing correction methods identified five statistically significant obesity  associated genes (NDUFA12, SFI1, SSB, FAR2 and LACE1) that require further  investigation.

Author information: (1)Center for Molecular Biology, University of Heidelberg, German Cancer  Research Center-Center for Molecular Biology Alliance, Heidelberg, Germany. (#)Contributed equally  The spindle pole body (SPB) provides microtubule-organizing functions in yeast  and duplicates exactly once per cell cycle. The first step in SPB duplication is  the half-bridge to bridge conversion via the antiparallel dimerization of the  centrin (Cdc31)-binding protein Sfi1 in anaphase. The bridge, which is anchored  to the old SPB on the proximal end, exposes free Sfi1 N-termini (N-Sfi1) at its  distal end. These free N-Sfi1 promote in G1 the assembly of the daughter SPB  (dSPB) in a yet unclear manner. This study shows that N-Sfi1 including the first  three Cdc31 binding sites interacts with the SPB components Spc29 and Spc42,  triggering the assembly of the dSPB. Cdc31 binding to N-Sfi1 promotes Spc29  recruitment and is essential for satellite formation. Furthermore,  phosphorylation of N-Sfi1 has an inhibitory effect and delays dSPB biogenesis  until G1. Taking these data together, we provide an understanding of the initial  steps in SPB assembly and describe a new function of Cdc31 in the recruitment of  dSPB components.  © 2021 Rüthnick et al.

Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at risk of long-term  cognitive and metabolic sequelae with some of the effects being attributed to  the chronic glucocorticoid treatment that they receive. Our pilot study  investigates genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with CAH to determine  whether there is preliminary evidence for epigenomic reprogramming as well as  any relationship to patient outcome. Here, we analysed CD4 + T cell DNA from 28  patients with CAH (mean age = 18.5 ± 6.5 years [y]) and 37 population controls  (mean age = 17.0 ± 6.1 y) with the Infinium-HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array  to measure genome-wide locus-specific DNA methylation levels. Effects of CAH,  phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype on methylation were investigated as well as the  association between differentially methylated CpGs and glucose homeostasis,  blood lipid profile, and cognitive functions. In addition, we report data on a  small cohort of 11 patients (mean age = 19.1, ±6.0 y) with CAH who were treated  prenatally with dexamethasone (DEX) in addition to postnatal glucocorticoid  treatment. We identified two CpGs to be associated with patient phenotype:  cg18486102 (located in the FAIM2 gene; rho = 0.58, adjusted p = 0.027) and  cg02404636 (located in the SFI1 gene; rho = 0.58, adjusted p = 0.038).  cg02404636 was also associated with genotype (rho = 0.59, adjusted p = 0.024).  Higher levels of serum C-peptide was also observed in patients with CAH  (p = 0.044). Additionally, levels of C-peptide and HbA1c were positively  correlated with patient phenotype (p = 0.044 and p = 0.034) and genotype  (p = 0.044 and p = 0.033), respectively. No significant association was found  between FAIM2 methylation and cognitive or metabolic outcome. However, SFI1 TSS  methylation was associated with fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels  (p = 0.035). In conclusion, in this pilot study, higher methylation levels in  CpG sites covering FAIM2 and SFI1 were associated with disease severity.  Hypermethylation in these genes may have implications for long-term cognitive  and metabolic outcome in patients with CAH, although the data must be  interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Additional studies in  larger cohorts are therefore warranted.  Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Centrin 2 is a small conserved calcium-binding protein that localizes to the  centriolar distal lumen in human cells. It is required for efficient primary  ciliogenesis and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Centrin 2 forms part of the  xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein complex. To explore how centrin 2  contributes to these distinct processes, we mutated the four calcium-binding  EF-hand domains of human centrin 2. Centrin 2 in which all four EF-hands had  been mutated to ablate calcium binding (4DA mutant) was capable of supporting in  vitro NER and was as effective as the wild-type protein in rescuing the UV  sensitivity of centrin 2-null cells. However, we found that mutation of any of  the EF-hand domains impaired primary ciliogenesis in human TERT-RPE1 cells to  the same extent as deletion of centrin 2. Phenotypic analysis of the 4DA mutant  revealed defects in centrosome localization, centriole satellite assembly,  ciliary assembly and function and in interactions with POC5 and SFI1. These  observations indicate that centrin 2 requires calcium-binding capacity for its  primary ciliogenesis functions, but not for NER, and suggest that these  functions require centrin 2 to be capable of forming complexes with partner  proteins.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first  author of the paper.  © 2019.

In mammals, centrioles participate in brain development, and human mutations  affecting centriole duplication cause microcephaly. Here, we identify a role for  the mammalian homologue of yeast SFI1, involved in the duplication of the yeast  spindle pole body, as a critical regulator of centriole duplication in mammalian  cells. Mammalian SFI1 interacts with USP9X, a deubiquitylase associated with  human syndromic mental retardation. SFI1 localizes USP9X to the centrosome  during S phase to deubiquitylate STIL, a critical regulator of centriole  duplication. USP9X-mediated deubiquitylation protects STIL from degradation.  Consistent with a role for USP9X in stabilizing STIL, cells from patients with  USP9X loss-of-function mutations have reduced STIL levels. Together, these  results demonstrate that SFI1 is a centrosomal protein that localizes USP9X to  the centrosome to stabilize STIL and promote centriole duplication. We propose  that the USP9X protection of STIL to facilitate centriole duplication underlies  roles of both proteins in human neurodevelopment.  © 2019 Kodani et al.

BACKGROUND: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life limiting genetic  disorder, characterized by chronic respiratory failure secondary to inflammation  and chronic bacterial lung infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection is  associated with more severe lung disease and rapid progression of respiratory  failure when compared to Staphylococcus aureus infection. We hypothesized that a  specific signature of epigenetic factors targeting specific gene transcripts  contributes to the increased morbidity seen in CF patients with chronic  Pseudomonas infection. METHODS: We collected exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from 27 subjects and  evaluated miRNA signatures in these samples using commercial PCR array. We  identified predicted mRNA targets and associated signaling pathways using  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: We found 11 differentially expressed miRNAs in EBC of patients infected  with Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to EBC from CF patients who were not  chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). Six of these miRNAs  (hsa-miRNA-1247, hsa-miRNA-1276, hsa-miRNA-449c, hsa-miRNA-3170,  hsa-miRNA-432-5p and hsa-miR-548) were significantly different in the CF  Pseudomonas positive group when compared to both the CF Pseudomonas negative  group and healthy control group. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed  organismal injury and abnormalities, reproductive system disease and cancer as  the top diseases and bio functions associated with these miRNAs. IPA also  detected RELA, JUN, TNF, IL-10, CTNNB1, IL-13, SERPINB8, CALM1, STARD3NL, SFI1,  CD55, RPS6KA4, TTC36 and HIST1H3D as the top target genes for these miRNAs. CONCLUSION: Our study identified 6 miRNAs as epigenetic factors specifically  associated with chronic Pseudomonas infection in patients with CF.  Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present paper, we characterized  the properties of metal ions as well as peptide R18-Sfi1p binding to human  centrin 1 (HsCen1) by fluorescence spectra and isothermal titration calorimetry  (ITC). Four metal ions binding sites on HsCen1 were identified through ITC  experiments. The conditional binding constants of the EF-hand domain on HsCen1  with Ca2+ were quantitatively calculated. In reversible manner, Ca2+ can induce  HsCen1 self-assembly. In addition, HsCen1 bound with peptide R18-Sfi1p in  calcium-dependent with middle-affinity. Phosphorylation at Ser170 weakened  interaction HsCen1 with the substrate and removal calcium ions further weakened  interactions of the two molecules. Hence, we inferred that centrin initiating  downstream peptides may be a double-regulated process by calcium and  phosphorylation. These results are of significance for understanding the  relationship between PTM and metal regulation.  Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The role of DNA methylation patterns in complex phenotypes remains unclear. To  explore this question, we adapted our methods for rare variant analysis to  characterize genome-wide murine DNA hybridization array to investigate  methylation at CpG islands, shores, and regulatory elements. We have applied  this platform to compare age and tissue- specific methylation differences in the  brain and spleen of young and aged mice. As expected from prior studies, there  are clear global differences in organ-specific, but not age-specific,  methylation due mostly to changes at repetitive elements. Surprisingly, out of  200,000 loci there were only 946 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs)  between young and old samples (529 hypermethylated, 417 hypomethylated in aged  mice) compared to thousands of tissue-specific DMCs. Hypermethylated loci were  clustered around the promoter region of Sfi1, exon 2 of Slc11a2, Drg1, Esr1 and  Foxa2 transcription factor binding sites. In particular, there were 75  hypermethylated Foxa2 binding sites across a 2.7 Mb region of chromosome 11.  Hypomethylated loci were clustered around Mid1, Isoc2b and genome-wide loci with  binding sites for Foxa2 and Esr1, which are known to play important roles in  development and aging. These data suggest discreet tissue-independent  methylation changes associated with aging processes such as cell division (Sfi1,  Mid1), energy production (Drg1, Isoc2b) and cell death (Foxa2, Esr1).

Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonic malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system  with heterogeneous biological, morphological, genetic and clinical  characteristics. Although genomic studies revealed the specific biological  features of NB pathogenesis useful for new therapeutic approaches, the  improvement of high-risk (HR)-NB patients overall survival remains  unsatisfactory. To further clarify the biological basis of disease  aggressiveness, we used whole-exome sequencing to examine the genomic landscape  of HR-NB patients at stage M with short survival (SS) and long survival (LS).  Only a few genes, including SMARCA4, SMO, ZNF44 and CHD2, were recurrently and  specifically mutated in the SS group, confirming the low recurrence of common  mutations in this tumor. A systems biology approach revealed that in the two  patient groups, mutations occurred in different pathways. Mutated genes  (ARHGEF11, CACNA1G, FGF4, PTPRA, PTK2, ANK3, SMO, NTNG2, VCL and NID2) regulate  the MAPK pathway associated with the organization of the extracellular matrix,  cell motility through PTK2 signaling and matrix metalloproteinase activity.  Moreover, we detected mutations in LAMA2, PTK2, LAMA4, and MMP14 genes,  impairing MET signaling, in SFI1 and CHD2 involved in centrosome maturation and  chromosome remodeling, in AK7 and SPTLC2, which regulate the metabolism of  nucleotides and lipoproteins, and in NALCN, SLC12A1, SLC9A9, which are involved  in the transport of small molecules. Notably, connected networks of somatically  mutated genes specific for SS patients were identified. The detection of mutated  genes present at the onset of disease may help to address an early treatment of  HR-NB patients using FDA-approved compounds targeting the deregulated pathways.  © 2018 UICC.

The half-bridge component Kar1 promotes centrosome separation and duplication  during budding yeast meiosis.  Agarwal M(1), Jin H(1), McClain M(2), Fan J(1), Koch BA(1), Jaspersen SL(2)(3),  Yu HG(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL  32306.

The budding yeast centrosome, often called the spindle pole body (SPB),  nucleates microtubules for chromosome segregation during cell division. An  appendage, called the half bridge, attaches to one side of the SPB and regulates  SPB duplication and separation. Like DNA, the SPB is duplicated only once per  cell cycle. During meiosis, however, after one round of DNA replication, two  rounds of SPB duplication and separation are coupled with homologue segregation  in meiosis I and sister-chromatid segregation in meiosis II. How SPB duplication  and separation are regulated during meiosis remains to be elucidated, and  whether regulation in meiosis differs from that in mitosis is unclear. Here we  show that overproduction of the half-bridge component Kar1 leads to premature  SPB separation during meiosis. Furthermore, excessive Kar1 induces SPB  overduplication to form supernumerary SPBs, leading to chromosome missegregation  and erroneous ascospore formation. Kar1--mediated SPB duplication bypasses the  requirement of dephosphorylation of Sfi1, another half-bridge component  previously identified as a licensing factor. Our results therefore reveal an  unexpected role of Kar1 in licensing meiotic SPB duplication and suggest a  unique mechanism of SPB regulation during budding yeast meiosis.

BACKGROUND: Chromocenters are defined as a punctate condensed blocks of  chromatin in the interphase cell nuclei of certain cell types with unknown  biological significance. In recent years a progress in revealing of  chromocenters protein content has been made although the details of DNA content  within constitutive heterochromatin still remain unclear. It is known that these  regions are enriched in tandem repeats (TR) and transposable elements. Quick  improvement of genome sequencing does not help to assemble the heterochromatic  regions due to lack of appropriate bioinformatics techniques. RESULTS: Chromocenters DNA have been isolated by a biochemical approach from  mouse liver cells nuclei and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq resulting in ChrmC  dataset. Analysis of ChrmC dataset by the bioinformatics tools available  revealed that the major component of chromocenter DNA are TRs: ~ 66% MaSat and  ~ 4% MiSat. Other previously classified TR families constitute ~ 1% of ChrmC  dataset. About 6% of chromocenters DNA are mostly unannotated sequences. In the  contigs assembled with IDBA_UD there are many fragments of heterochromatic  Y-chromosome, rDNA and other pseudo-genes and non-coding DNA. A protein coding  sfi1 homolog gene fragment was also found in contigs. The Sfi1 homolog gene is  located on the chromosome 11 in the reference genome very close to the Golden  Pass Gap (a ~ 3 Mb empty region reserved to the pericentromeric region) and  proves the purity of chromocenters isolation. The second major fraction are  non-LTR retroposons (SINE and LINE) with overwhelming majority of LINE - ~ 11%  of ChrmC. Most of the LINE fragments are from the ~ 2 kb region at the end of  the 2nd ORF and its' flanking region. The precise LINEs' segment of ~ 2 kb is  the necessary mouse constitutive heterohromatin component together with TR. The  third most abundant fraction are ERVs. The ERV distribution in chromocenters  differs from the whole genome: IAP (ERV2 class) is the most numerous in ChrmC  while MaLR (ERV3 class) prevails in the reference genome. IAP and its LTR also  prevail in TR containing contigs extracted from the WGS dataset. In silico  prediction of IAP and LINE fragments in chromocenters was confirmed by direct  fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). CONCLUSION: Our data of chromocenters' DNA (ChrmC) sequencing demonstrate that  IAP with LTR and a precise ~ 2 kb fragment of LINE represent a substantial  fraction of mouse chromocenters (constitutive heteroсhromatin) along with TRs.

Individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) have, on average, a 10- to 20-year shorter  expected life span than the rest of the population, primarily due to  cardiovascular disease comorbidity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have  previously been used to separately identify common variants in SCZ and  cardiometabolic traits. However, genetic variants jointly influencing both  traits remain to be fully characterised. To assess overlaps (if any) between the  genetic architecture of SCZ and cardiometabolic traits, we used conditional  false discovery rate (FDR) and local genetic correlation statistical framework  analyses. A conjunctional FDR was used to identify shared genetic traits between  SCZ and cardiometabolic risk factors. We identified 144 genetic variants which  were shared between SCZ and body mass index (BMI), and 15 variants shared  between SCZ and triglycerides (TG). Furthermore, we discovered four novel single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3865350, rs9860913, rs13307 and rs9614186)  and four proximate genes (DERL2, SNX4, LY75 and EFCAB6) which were shared by SCZ  and BMI. We observed that the novel genetic variant rs13307 and the most  proximate gene LY75 exerted potential effects on SCZ and BMI comorbidity. Also,  we observed a mixture of concordant and opposite direction associations with  shared genetic variants. We demonstrated a moderate to high genetic overlap  between SCZ and cardiometabolic traits associated with a pattern of  bidirectional associations. Our data suggested a complex interplay between  metabolism-related gene pathways in SCZ pathophysiology.  © 2022. The Author(s).

Trigeminal (TG), dorsal root (DRG), and nodose/jugular (NG/JG) ganglia each  possess specialized and distinct functions. We used RNA sequencing of two-cycle  sorted Pirt-positive neurons to identify genes exclusively expressing in L3-L5  DRG, T10-L1 DRG, NG/JG, and TG mouse ganglion neurons. Transcription factor  Phox2b and Efcab6 are specifically expressed in NG/JG while Hoxa7 is exclusively  present in both T10-L1 and L3-L5 DRG neurons. Cyp2f2, Krt18, and Ptgds, along  with pituitary hormone prolactin (Prl), growth hormone (Gh), and  proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) encoding genes are almost exclusively in TG neurons.  Immunohistochemistry confirmed selective expression of these hormones in TG  neurons and dural nerves; and showed GH expression in subsets of TRPV1+ and  CGRP+ TG neurons. We next examined GH roles in hypersensitivity in the spinal  versus trigeminal systems. Exogenous GH produced mechanical hypersensitivity  when injected intrathecally, but not intraplantarly. GH-induced thermal  hypersensitivity was not detected in the spinal system. GH dose-dependently  generated orofacial and headache-like periorbital mechanical hypersensitivity  after administration into masseter muscle and dura, respectively. Periorbital  mechanical hypersensitivity was reversed by a GH receptor antagonist,  pegvisomant. Overall, pituitary hormone genes are selective for TG versus other  ganglia somatotypes; and GH has distinctive functional significance in the  trigeminal versus spinal systems.  © 2021.

Cilia are complex microtubule-based organelles essential to a range of processes  associated with embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in components of  these organelles or those involved in their assembly may result in a diverse set  of diseases collectively known as ciliopathies. Accordingly, many  cilia-associated proteins have been described, while those distinguishing cilia  subtypes are poorly defined. Here we set out to define genes associated with  motile cilia in humans based on their transcriptional signature. To define the  signature, we performed network deconvolution of transcriptomics data derived  from tissues possessing motile ciliated cell populations. For each tissue, genes  coexpressed with the motile cilia-associated transcriptional factor, FOXJ1, were  identified. The consensus across tissues provided a transcriptional signature of  248 genes. To validate these, we examined the literature, databases (CilDB,  CentrosomeDB, CiliaCarta and SysCilia), single cell RNA-Seq data, and the  localisation of mRNA and proteins in motile ciliated cells. In the case of six  poorly characterised signature genes, we performed new localisation experiments  on ARMC3, EFCAB6, FAM183A, MYCBPAP, RIBC2 and VWA3A. In summary, we report a set  of motile cilia-associated genes that helps shape our understanding of these  complex cellular organelles.

The central nervous system of the Ciona larva contains only 177 neurons. The  precise regulation of neuron subtype-specific morphogenesis and differentiation  observed during the formation of this minimal connectome offers a unique  opportunity to dissect gene regulatory networks underlying chordate  neurodevelopment. Here we compare the transcriptomes of two very distinct neuron  types in the hindbrain/spinal cord homolog of Ciona, the Motor Ganglion (MG):  the Descending decussating neuron (ddN, proposed homolog of Mauthner Cells in  vertebrates) and the MG Interneuron 2 (MGIN2). Both types are invariantly  represented by a single bilaterally symmetric left/right pair of cells in every  larva. Supernumerary ddNs and MGIN2s were generated in synchronized embryos and  isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for transcriptome profiling.  Differential gene expression analysis revealed ddN- and MGIN2-specific  enrichment of a wide range of genes, including many encoding potential  ""effectors"" of subtype-specific morphological and functional traits. More  specifically, we identified the upregulation of centrosome-associated,  microtubule-stabilizing/bundling proteins and extracellular guidance cues part  of a single intrinsic regulatory program that might underlie the unique  polarization of the ddNs, the only descending MG neurons that cross the midline.  Consistent with our predictions, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, tissue-specific  elimination of two such candidate effectors, Efcab6-related and Netrin1,  impaired ddN polarized axon outgrowth across the midline.

As a result, the frequency of autosomal recessive  diseases is relatively high in the region with the co-occurrence of two or more  diseases. METHODS: We report here on a consanguineous Libyan family whose child was  initially diagnosed as presenting Fanconi anemia (FA) with uncommon skeletal  deformities. The chromosome breakage test has been performed using mitomycin C  (MMC) while molecular analysis was performed by a combined approach of linkage  analysis and whole exome sequencing. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analyses showed that the karyotype of the female patient is  46,XY suggesting the diagnosis of a disorder of sex development (DSD). By  looking at the genetic etiology of FA and DSD, we have identified  p.[Arg798*];[Arg798*] mutation in FANCJ (OMIM #605882) gene responsible for FA  and p.[Arg108*];[Arg1497Trp] in EFCAB6 (Gene #64800) gene responsible for DSD.  In addition, we have incidentally discovered a novel mutation  p.[Gly1372Arg];[Gly1372Arg] in the ERCC6 (CSB) (OMIM #609413) gene responsible  for COFS that might explain the atypical severe skeletal deformities.

PURPOSE: Germline mutations within melanoma susceptibility genes are present  only in minority of melanoma patients and it is expected that additional genes  will be discovered with next generation sequence technology and whole-exome  sequencing (WES). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein we performed WES on a cohort of 96 unrelated  Polish patients with melanoma diagnosed under the age of 40 years who all  screened negative for the presence of CDKN2Avariants. A replication study using  a set of 1,200 melanoma patient DNA samples and similarly large series of  healthy controls was undertaken. RESULTS: We selected 21 potentially deleterious variants in 20 genes (VRK1,  MYCT1, DNAH14, CASC3, MS4A12, PRC1, WWOX, CARD6, EXO5, CASC3, CASP8AP2, STK33,  SAMD11, CNDP2, CPNE1, EFCAB6, CABLES1, LEKR1, NUDT17, and RRP15), which were  identified by WES and confirmed by Sanger sequencing for an association study.  Evaluation of the allele distribution among carriers and their relatives in  available family trios revealed that these variants were unlikely to account for  many familial cases of melanoma. Replication study revealed no statistically  significant differences between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: Although most of the changes seemed to be neutral we could not  exclude an association between variants in VRK1, CREB3L3, EXO5, and STK33 with  melanoma risk.

The deglycase and chaperone protein DJ-1 is pivotal for cellular oxidative  stress responses and mitochondrial quality control. Mutations in PARK7, encoding  DJ-1, are associated with early-onset familial Parkinson's disease and lead to  pathological oxidative stress and/or disrupted protein degradation by the  proteasome. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the pathogenic  mechanisms of selected DJ-1 missense mutations, by characterizing  protein-protein interactions, core parameters of mitochondrial function, quality  control regulation via autophagy, and cellular death following dopamine  accumulation. We report that the DJ-1M26I mutant influences DJ-1 interactions  with SUMO-1, in turn enhancing removal of mitochondria and conferring increased  cellular susceptibility to dopamine toxicity. By contrast, the DJ-1D149A mutant  does not influence mitophagy, but instead impairs Ca2+ dynamics and free radical  homeostasis by disrupting DJ-1 interactions with a mitochondrial accessory  protein known as DJ-1-binding protein (DJBP/EFCAB6). Thus, individual DJ-1  mutations have different effects on mitochondrial function and quality control,  implying mutation-specific pathomechanisms converging on impaired mitochondrial  homeostasis.

Electronic address:  rpowers@unl.edu.  Previous studies have shown that relaxation parameters and fast protein dynamics  can be quickly elucidated from 15N-CEST experiments [1]. Longitudinal R1 and  transverse R2 values were reliably derived from fitting of CEST profiles. Herein  we show that 15N-CEST experiments and traditional modelfree analysis provide the  internal dynamics of three states of human protein DJ-1 at physiological  temperature. The chemical exchange profiles show the absence of a minor state  conformation and, in conjunction with 1H-15N NOEs, show increased mobility. R1  and R2 values remained relatively unchanged at the three naturally occurring  oxidation states of DJ-1, but exhibit striking NOE differences. The NOE data  was, therefore, essential in determining the internal motions of the DJ-1  proteins. To the authors' knowledge, we present the first study that combines  15N CEST data with traditional model-free analyses in the study of a biological  system and affirm that more 'lean' model-free approaches should be used  cautiously.

Fetal-adult cardiac transcriptome analysis in rats with contrasting left  ventricular mass reveals new candidates for cardiac hypertrophy.

Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charité Centrum für  Therapieforschung, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. (2)Genetic Epidemiology, University of Münster, Münster, Germany.  Reactivation of fetal gene expression patterns has been implicated in common  cardiac diseases in adult life including left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH)  in arterial hypertension. Thus, increased wall stress and neurohumoral  activation are discussed to induce the return to expression of fetal genes after  birth in LVH. We therefore aimed to identify novel potential candidates for LVH  by analyzing fetal-adult cardiac gene expression in a genetic rat model of  hypertension, i.e. the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP). To  this end we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis in SHRSP to identify  differences in expression patterns between day 20 of fetal development (E20) and  adult animals in week 14 in comparison to a normotensive rat strain with  contrasting low LV mass, i.e. Fischer (F344). 15232 probes were detected as  expressed in LV tissue obtained from rats at E20 and week 14 (p < 0.05) and  subsequently screened for differential expression. We identified 24 genes with  SHRSP specific up-regulation and 21 genes with down-regulation as compared to  F344. Further bioinformatic analysis presented Efcab6 as a new candidate for LVH  that showed only in the hypertensive SHRSP rat differential expression during  development (logFC = 2.41, p < 0.001) and was significantly higher expressed in  adult SHRSP rats compared with adult F344 (+ 76%) and adult normotensive  Wistar-Kyoto rats (+ 82%). Thus, it represents an interesting new target for  further functional analyses and the elucidation of mechanisms leading to LVH.  Here we report a new approach to identify candidate genes for cardiac  hypertrophy by combining the analysis of gene expression differences between  strains with a contrasting cardiac phenotype with a comparison of fetal-adult  cardiac expression patterns.

Identification of a HMGA2-EFCAB6 gene rearrangement following next-generation  sequencing in a patient with a t(12;22)(q14.3;q13.2) and JAK2V617F-positive  myeloproliferative neoplasm.  Martin SE(1), Sausen M, Joseph A, Kingham BF, Martin ES.  Author information: (1)Helen F. Graham Cancer Center, Newark, DE, USA. semartin@cbg.org  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) result from genetically altered  hematopoietic stem cells that retain the capacity for multilineage  differentiation. The study of genomic mutations identified so far suggests that  they occur after a common ancestral event or that different mutations result in  similar MPN phenotypes. We report analysis of a chromosomal translocation,  t(12;22)(q14.3;q13.2), in a patient with a BCR-ABL1-negative, JAK2V617F-positive  MPN. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array and targeted sequencing  detected no mutation in nine genes reported to influence the JAK2V617F-driven  MPNs (MPL, LNK, CBL, TET2, EZH2, IKZF1, IDH1, IDH2, ASXL1). Next-generation  sequencing revealed a balanced HMGA2-EFCAB6 genomic rearrangement. The HMGA2  breakpoint leads to the loss of seven 3'UTR binding sites for the microRNA  (miRNA) let-7 tumor suppressor. The breakpoint in the EFCAB6 gene abrogates  transcription of EFCAB6. Measurement of expression showed retention of HMGA2  transcription and no detectable EFCAB6 transcript. Allele burden comparison in a  sample containing the translocation, showed 90% HMGA2-EFCAB6 versus 50%  JAK2V617F allele dose, suggesting HMGA2-EFCAB6 rearrangement plays a more  ancestral role, pre-JAK2V617F, in the neoplastic process. The pathogenicity of  the translocation may rest on collaborations among JAK2V617F-induced  constitutive activation of JAK2, the oncogenic property of HMGA2, and disrupted  pathways, such as alteration in DJ-1 expression, resulting from the impact of  EFCAB6 abrogation.

Author information: (1)Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affairs Puget  Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA. lbekris@u.washington.edu  Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. In  most instances, PD is thought to result from a complex interaction between  multiple genetic and environmental factors, though rare monogenic forms of the  disease do exist. Mutations in 6 genes (SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, DJ1, PINK1, and  ATP13A2) have conclusively been shown to cause familial parkinsonism. In  addition, common variation in 3 genes (MAPT, LRRK2, and SNCA) and  loss-of-function mutations in GBA have been well-validated as susceptibility  factors for PD. The function of these genes and their contribution to PD  pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. The prevalence, incidence, clinical  manifestations, and genetic components of PD are discussed in this review.

DJBP: a novel DJ-1-binding protein, negatively regulates the androgen receptor  by recruiting histone deacetylase complex, and DJ-1 antagonizes this inhibition  by abrogation of this complex.  Niki T(1), Takahashi-Niki K, Taira T, Iguchi-Ariga SM, Ariga H.  Author information: (1)Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and College of Medical Technology,  Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Japan.  DJ-1 was identified by us as a novel oncogene that transforms mouse NIH3T3 cells  in cooperation with ras. We later identified PIAS (protein inhibitor of  activated STAT)xalpha as a DJ-1-binding protein, and found that DJ-1 restored  androgen receptor (AR) transcription activity that was repressed by PIASxalpha.  To further characterize the function of DJ-1, we cloned cDNA encoding a novel  DJ-1-binding protein, DJBP, by a yeast two-hybrid system. DJBP mRNA was found to  be specifically expressed in the testis. In addition to the binding of DJBP to  the COOH-terminal region of DJ-1, DJBP was also found to bind in vitro and in  vivo to the DNA-binding domain of the AR in a testosterone-dependent manner and  to be colocalized with DJ-1 or AR in the nucleus. Furthermore, a  co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the formation of a ternary complex  between DJ-1, DJBP, and AR occurred in cells in which DJ-1 bound to the AR via  DJBP. It was found that DJBP repressed a testosterone-dependent AR  transactivation activity in monkey Cos1 cells by recruiting histone deacetylase  (HDAC) complex, including HDAC1 and mSin3, and that DJ-1 partially restored its  repressed activity by abrogating DJBP-HDAC complex. These results suggest that  AR is positively regulated by DJ-1, which antagonizes the function of negative  regulators, including DJBP.  PMID: 12612053 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",['cancer']

Variants with large effect contribute to congenital heart disease (CHD). To  date, recessive genotypes (RGs) have commonly been implicated through anecdotal  ascertainment of consanguineous families and candidate gene-based analysis; the  recessive contribution to the broad range of CHD phenotypes has been limited. We  analyzed whole exome sequences of 5,424 CHD probands. Rare damaging RGs were  estimated to contribute to at least 2.2% of CHD, with greater enrichment among  laterality phenotypes (5.4%) versus other subsets (1.4%). Among 108 curated  human recessive CHD genes, there were 66 RGs, with 54 in 11 genes with >1 RG, 12  genes with 1 RG, and 85 genes with zero. RGs were more prevalent among offspring  of consanguineous union (4.7%, 32/675) than among nonconsanguineous probands  (0.7%, 34/4749). Founder variants in GDF1 and PLD1 accounted for 74% of the  contribution of RGs among 410 Ashkenazi Jewish probands. We identified  genome-wide significant enrichment of RGs in C1orf127, encoding a likely  secreted protein expressed in embryonic mouse notochord and associated with  laterality defects. Single-cell transcriptomes from gastrulation-stage mouse  embryos revealed enrichment of RGs in genes highly expressed in the  cardiomyocyte lineage, including contractility-related genes MYH6, UNC45B,  MYO18B, and MYBPC3 in probands with left-sided CHD, consistent with abnormal  contractile function contributing to these malformations. Genes with significant  RG burden account for 1.3% of probands, more than half the inferred total. These  results reveal the recessive contribution to CHD, and indicate that many genes  remain to be discovered, with each likely accounting for a very small fraction  of the total.

Many cancer cells exhibit increased amounts of paucimannose glycans, which are  truncated N-glycan structures rarely found in mammals. Paucimannosidic proteins  are proposedly generated within lysosomes and exposed on the cell surface  through a yet uncertain mechanism. In this study, we revealed that  paucimannosidic proteins are produced by lysosomal glycosidases and secreted via  lysosomal exocytosis. Interestingly, lysosomal exocytosis preferentially  occurred in the vicinity of focal adhesions, protein complexes connecting the  actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Through genome-wide knockout  screening, we identified that MYO18B, an actin crosslinker, is required for  focal adhesion maturation, facilitating lysosomal exocytosis and the release of  paucimannosidic lysosomal proteins to the extracellular milieu. Moreover, a  mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 locally activated at focal adhesions  imports Ca2+ necessary for lysosome-plasma membrane fusion. Collectively, our  study unveiled an intimate relationship between lysosomal exocytosis and focal  adhesion, shedding light on the unexpected interplay between lysosomal  activities and cellular mechanosensing.  © 2025 Crown copyright.

Heart structure and function change with age, and the notion that the heart may  age faster for some individuals than for others has driven interest in  estimating cardiac age acceleration. However, current approaches have limited  feature richness (heart measurements; radiomics) or capture extraneous data and  therefore lack cardiac specificity (deep learning [DL] on unmasked chest MRI).  These technical limitations have been a barrier to efforts to understand genetic  contributions to age acceleration. We hypothesized that a video-based DL model  provided with heart-masked MRI data would capture a rich yet cardiac-specific  representation of cardiac aging. In 61,691 UK Biobank participants, we excluded  noncardiac pixels from cardiac MRI and trained a video-based DL model to predict  age from one cardiac cycle in the 4-chamber view. We then computed cardiac age  acceleration as the bias-corrected prediction of heart age minus the calendar  age. Predicted heart age explained 71.1% of variance in calendar age, with a  mean absolute error of 3.3 years. Cardiac age acceleration was linked to  unfavorable cardiac geometry and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. We also  observed links between cardiac age acceleration and diet, decreased physical  activity, increased alcohol and tobacco use, and altered levels of 239 serum  proteins, as well as adverse brain MRI characteristics. We found cardiac age  acceleration to be heritable (h2g 26.6%); a genome-wide association study  identified 8 loci related to linked to cardiomyopathy (near TTN, TNS1, LSM3,  PALLD, DSP, PLEC, ANKRD1 and MYO18B) and an additional 16 loci (near MECOM,  NPR3, KLHL3, HDGFL1, CDKN1A, ELN, SLC25A37, PI15, AP3M1, HMGA2, ADPRHL1, PGAP3,  WNT9B, UHRF1 and DOK5). Of the discovered loci, 21 were not previously  associated with cardiac age acceleration. Mendelian randomization revealed that  lower genetically mediated levels of 6 circulating proteins (MSRA most  strongly), as well as greater levels of 5 proteins (LXN most strongly) were  associated with cardiac age acceleration, as were greater blood pressure and  Lp(a). A polygenic score for cardiac age acceleration predicted earlier onset of  arrhythmia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and mortality. These findings  provide a thematic understanding of cardiac age acceleration and suggest that  heart- and vascular-specific factors are key to cardiac age acceleration,  predominating over a more global aging program.

BACKGROUND: BCR::ABL1-like or Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) acute  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was first reported in 2009. Ph-like ALL is  characterized by gene signature similar to Philadelphia chromosome ALL, but  without BCR::ABL1 fusions. Molecularly, Ph-like ALL is divided into seven  categories, with CRLF2 and ABL-class rearrangements being the two most common  subtypes, exhibiting alterations in distinct downstream signaling cascades. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of pediatric Ph-like ALL with  concomitant CRLF2 and ABL1 rearrangements. CRLF2 was fused with P2RY8, its most  common fusion partner, whereas ABL1 was fused with MYO18B, a novel fusion  partner that has not been previously reported. The 4-year-old female patient was  treated using the national multicenter CCCG-ALL-2020 protocol with the addition  of dasatinib at the end of induction when ABL1 rearrangement was confirmed by  RNA-seq. Morphologically and molecularly, the patient remained in continuous  remission until the last follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the  first case of Ph-like ALL harboring two distinct rearrangement categories. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified that ABL1 rearrangement and CRLF2  rearrangement can coexist. The application of FISH, whole transcription  sequencing, PCR can help us to have a more comprehensive understanding of ALL  cytogenetics and molecular biology. Further studies are needed to explore the  role of targeted therapies in such rare clinical scenarios.  © 2024. The Author(s).

Horsthemke M(1), Arnaud CA(1)(2), Hanley PJ(1).  Author information: (1)IMM Institute for Molecular Medicine, HMU Health and Medical University  Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany. (2)Department of Medicine, Science Faculty, MSB Medical School Berlin, Berlin,  Germany.  Initially, the two members of class 18 myosins, Myo18A and Myo18B, appeared to  exhibit highly divergent functions, complicating the assignment of  class-specific functions. However, the identification of a striated  muscle-specific isoform of Myo18A, Myo18Aγ, suggests that class 18 myosins may  have evolved to complement the functions of conventional class 2 myosins in  sarcomeres. Indeed, both genes, Myo18a and Myo18b, are predominantly expressed  in the heart and somites, precursors of skeletal muscle, of developing mouse  embryos. Genetic deletion of either gene in mice is embryonic lethal and is  associated with the disorganization of cardiac sarcomeres. Moreover, Myo18Aγ and  Myo18B localize to sarcomeric A-bands, albeit the motor (head) domains of these  unconventional myosins have been both deduced and biochemically demonstrated to  exhibit negligible ATPase activity, a hallmark of motor proteins. Instead,  Myo18Aγ and Myo18B presumably coassemble with thick filaments and provide  structural integrity and/or internal resistance through interactions with  F-actin and/or other proteins. In addition, Myo18Aγ and Myo18B may play distinct  roles in the assembly of myofibrils, which may arise from actin stress fibers  containing the α-isoform of Myo18A, Myo18Aα. The β-isoform of Myo18A, Myo18Aβ,  is similar to Myo18Aα, except that it lacks the N-terminal extension, and may  serve as a negative regulator through heterodimerization with either Myo18Aα or  Myo18Aγ. In this review, we contend that Myo18Aγ and Myo18B are essential for  myofibril structure and function in striated muscle cells, while α- and  β-isoforms of Myo18A play diverse roles in nonmuscle cells.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Albeit considered with superior survival, around 30% of the  early-stage non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (Ns-NSCLC) patients relapse  within 5 years, suggesting unique biology. However, the biological  characteristics of early-stage Ns-NSCLC, especially in the Chinese population,  are still unclear. METHODS: Multi-omics interrogation of early-stage Ns-NSCLC (stage I-III), paired  blood samples and normal lung tissues (n=76) by whole-exome sequencing (WES),  RNA sequencing, and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were conducted. RESULTS: An average of 128 exonic mutations were identified, and the most  frequently mutant gene was EGFR (55%), followed by TP53 (37%) and TTN (26%).  Mutations in MUC17, ABCA2, PDE4DIP, and MYO18B predicted significantly  unfavorable disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, cytobands amplifications in  8q24.3, 14q13.1, 14q11.2, and deletion in 3p21.1 were highlighted in recurrent  cases. Higher incidence of human leukocyte antigen loss of heterozygosity  (HLA-LOH), higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden  (TNB) were identified in ever-smokers than never-smokers. HLA-LOH also  correlated with higher TMB, TNB, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), and whole  chromosomal instability (wCIN) scores. Interestingly, higher ITH was an  independent predictor of better DFS in early-stage Ns-NSCLC. Up-regulation of  immune-related genes, including CRABP2, ULBP2, IL31RA, and IL1A, independently  portended a dismal prognosis. Enhanced TCR diversity of peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (PBMCs) predicted better prognosis, indicative of a  noninvasive method for relapse surveillance. Eventually, seven machine-learning  (ML) algorithms were employed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of clinical,  genomic, transcriptomic, and TCR repertoire data on DFS, showing that clinical  and RNA features combination in the random forest (RF) algorithm, with area  under the curve (AUC) of 97.5% and 83.3% in the training and testing cohort,  respectively, significantly outperformed other methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively profiled the genomic, transcriptomic,  and TCR repertoire spectrums of Chinese early-stage Ns-NSCLC, shedding light on  biological underpinnings and candidate biomarkers for prognosis development.  2024 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is a rare congenital disorder  characterized by the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae during early  prenatal development. This fusion results from a failure of segmentation during  the first trimester. Although six genes have previously been associated with  KFS, they account for only a small proportion of cases. Among the distinct  subtypes of KFS, ""sandwich fusion"" involving concurrent fusion of C0-1 and C2-3  vertebrae is particularly noteworthy due to its heightened risk for atlantoaxial  dislocation. In this study, we aimed to investigate novel candidate mutations in  patients with ""sandwich fusion."" METHODS: We collected and analyzed clinical data from 21 patients diagnosed with  ""sandwich fusion."" Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed, followed by  rigorous bioinformatics analyses. Our focus was on the six known KFS-related  genes (GDF3, GDF6, MEOX1, PAX1, RIPPLY2, and MYO18). Suspicious mutations were  subsequently validated through in vitro experiments. RESULTS: Our investigation revealed two novel exonic mutations in the FGFR2  gene, which had not previously been associated with KFS. Notably, the  c.1750A > G variant in Exon 13 of FGFR2 was situated within the tyrosine kinase  domain of the protein, in close proximity to several established  post-translational modification sites. In vitro experiments demonstrated that  this certain mutation significantly impacted the function of FGFR2. Furthermore,  we identified four heterozygous candidate variants in two genes (PAX1 and  MYO18B) in two patients, with three of these variants predicted to have  potential clinical significance directly linked to KFS. CONCLUSIONS: This study encompassed the largest cohort of patients with the  unique ""sandwich fusion"" subtype of KFS and employed WES to explore candidate  mutations associated with this condition. Our findings unveiled novel variants  in PAX1, MYO18B, and FGFR2 as potential risk mutations specific to this subtype  of KFS.  © 2024. The Author(s).

In individuals  under the age of 35 years sudden arrhythmic death is the most frequent cause. In  younger persons, genetically determined cardiac diseases (eg, cardiomyopathies  and ion-channel diseases) account for an important proportion of these cases. METHODS: We investigated the case of a 23-year-old male with SCD, specific ECG  changes and left ventricular hypertrophy. Family history was significant for SCD  in the paternal line. A precise analysis was performed by an international  multidisciplinary expert panel including autopsy of the index patient's heart,  molecular autopsy, whole-exome sequencing, analysis of the pedigree and  examination of available family members. RESULTS: Three cases of SCD were reported in paternal relatives. The index  patient exhibited specific ECG changes (ST-depression), which were also found in  five paternal relatives and the brother of the index patient. Post-mortem  analysis of the heart yielded mild idiopathic concentric hypertrophy without  myocardial disarray. The genetic analysis of the index patient showed two  nucleotide variations in two different genes (ANK2: c.11791G>A, MYO18B:  c.3761G>A), which were also expressed in five relatives. Two family members had  showed all indicators of the inherited syndrome including distinct ECG changes  and genetic changes. CONCLUSION: We describe a distinct inheritable syndrome causing SCD,  characterized by specific ECG changes and mutations of ANK2 and MYO18. As far as  we know this is the first description of this syndrome.  © 2023 von Korn et al.

Background: Microcephaly is common in patients with neuropsychiatric problems,  and it is usually closely related to genetic causes. However, studies on  chromosomal abnormalities and single-gene disorders associated with fetal  microcephaly are limited. Objective: We investigated the cytogenetic and  monogenic risks of fetal microcephaly and evaluated their pregnancy outcomes.  Methods: We performed a clinical evaluation, high-resolution chromosomal  microarray analysis (CMA), and trio exome sequencing (ES) on 224 fetuses with  prenatal microcephaly and closely followed the pregnancy outcome and prognosis.  Results: Among 224 cases of prenatal fetal microcephaly, the diagnosis rate was  3.74% (7/187) for CMA and 19.14% (31/162) for trio-ES. Exome sequencing  identified 31 pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) single nucleotide variants  (SNVs) in 25 genes associated with fetal structural abnormalities in 37  microcephaly fetuses; 19 (61.29%) of which occurred de novo. Variants of unknown  significance (VUS) was found in 33/162 (20.3%) fetuses. The gene variant  involved included the single gene MPCH 2 and MPCH 11, which is associated with  human microcephaly, and HDAC8, TUBGCP6, NIPBL, FANCI, PDHA1, UBE3A, CASK,  TUBB2A, PEX1, PPFIBP1, KNL1, SLC26A4, SKIV2L, COL1A2, EBP, ANKRD11, MYO18B,  OSGEP, ZEB2, TRIO, CLCN5, CASK, and LAGE3. The live birth rate of fetal  microcephaly in the syndromic microcephaly group was significantly higher than  that in the primary microcephaly group [62.9% (117/186) vs 31.56% (12/38), p =  0.000]. Conclusion: We conducted a prenatal study by conducting CMA and ES for  the genetic analysis of fetal microcephaly cases. CMA and ES had a high  diagnostic rate for the genetic causes of fetal microcephaly cases. In this  study, we also identified 14 novel variants, which expanded the disease spectrum  of microcephaly-related genes.

Imaging and genetic studies have characterized biological risk factors  contributing to specific reading disability (SRD). The current study aimed to  apply this literature to a family of twins discordant for SRD and an older  sibling with reading difficulty. Intraclass correlations were used to understand  the similarity of imaging phenotypes between pairs. Reading-related genes and  brain region phenotypes, including asymmetry indices representing the relative  size of left compared to right hemispheric structures, were descriptively  examined. SNPs that corresponded between the SRD siblings and not the typically  developing (TD) siblings were in genes ZNF385D, LPHN3, CNTNAP2, FGF18, NOP9,  CMIP, MYO18B, and RBFOX2. Imaging phenotypes were similar among all sibling  pairs for grey matter volume and surface area, but cortical thickness in  reading-related regions of interest (ROIs) was more similar among the siblings  with SRD, followed by the twins, and then the TD twin and older siblings,  suggesting cortical thickness may differentiate risk for this family. The  siblings with SRD had more symmetry of cortical thickness in the transverse  temporal and superior temporal gyri, while the TD sibling had greater rightward  asymmetry. The TD sibling had a greater leftward asymmetry of grey matter volume  and cortical surface area in the fusiform, supramarginal, and transverse  temporal gyrus. This exploratory study demonstrated that reading-related risk  factors appeared to correspond with SRD within this family, suggesting that  early examination of biological factors may benefit early identification. Future  studies may benefit from the use of polygenic risk scores or machine learning to  better understand SRD risk.

BACKGROUND: Deciphering hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) pathogenesis is  confounded by its genetic heterogeneity and oligogenic underpinnings. METHODS: Whole genome sequences were analyzed by 3 independent strategies to  identify HLHS gene candidates, ranked by variant, gene, and disease-level  metrics. RESULTS: First, a genome-wide association study of 174 cases and 853 controls  revealed suggestive association with a MYO18B intron 33 variant (rs2269628-G;  frequency=0.55 versus 0.39; OR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.54-2.52]; P=6.70×10-8). Second,  transmission disequilibrium testing of 161 HLHS proband-parent trios revealed  overrepresentation of a MYO18B intron 42 variant (rs73154186-A; frequency=0.05;  OR, 24 [95% CI, 3.2-177.4]; P=4.23×10-6). Third, rare, predicted-damaging  variants were filtered in 2 multiplex families. In 141H, 2 fifth-degree  relatives with HLHS shared a paternally-inherited MYO5A missense variant  (p.Arg801Trp; frequency=0.00003; combined annotation-dependent depletion  score=29), each with a maternally-inherited or de novo candidate modifier  variant in a MYO5A-interacting conventional myosin. In 442H, a HLHS proband was  compound heterozygous for MYO15A variants-a maternally-inherited pathogenic  stop-gain variant co-segregating with tetralogy of Fallot and bicuspid aortic  valve in maternal relatives (p.Tyr2819Ter; frequency=0.00003) and a  paternally-inherited intronic variant altering a canonical transcription factor  binding site (rs1277068603; frequency=0.00001; position weight matrix  score=0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that common and rare alleles  within unconventional myosin genes are associated with HLHS susceptibility. The  identified candidate MYO18B regulates cardiac sarcomerogenesis, supporting the  hypothesis of intrinsic myogenic perturbation in arrested left heart  development.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Molecular subtypes and genomic changes in HNC samples from  patients of African and European ancestry in The Cancer Genome Atlas, Memorial  Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Broad Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and  John Hopkins University were identified. Molecular features (genomic, proteomic,  transcriptomic) associated with race and genomic alterations associated with  clinical outcomes were determined. An independent cohort of HNC tumor specimens  was used to validate the primary findings using IHC. RESULTS: Black patients were found to have a younger age at diagnosis, more  aggressive tumor types, higher rates of metastasis, and worse survival compared  with White patients. Black patients had fewer human papillomavirus-positive  tumor types and higher frequencies of laryngeal subtype tumors. Higher  frequencies of TP53, MYO18B, KMT2D, and UNC13C mutations and a lower frequency  of PIK3CA mutations were observed in Black patients. Tumors of Black patients  showed significant enrichment of c-MYC and RET-tyrosine signaling and  amplifications. A significant increase in tumor expression of c-MYC in Black  patients was observed and was associated with poor survival outcomes in the  independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Novel genomic modifications and molecular signatures may be related  to environmental, social, and behavioral factors associated with racial  disparities in HNC. Unique tumor mutations and biological pathways have  potential clinical utility in providing more targeted and individualized  screening, diagnostic, and treatment modalities to improve health outcomes.  ©2022 American Association for Cancer Research.

DNA methylation is a process that can affect gene accessibility and therefore  gene expression. In this study, a machine learning pipeline is proposed for the  prediction of breast cancer and the identification of significant genes that  contribute to the prediction. The current study utilized breast cancer  methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), specifically the TCGA-BRCA  dataset. Feature engineering techniques have been utilized to reduce data volume  and make deep learning scalable. A comparative analysis of the proposed approach  on Illumina 27K and 450K methylation data reveals that deep learning  methodologies for cancer prediction can be coupled with feature selection models  to enhance prediction accuracy. Prediction using 450K methylation markers can be  accomplished in less than 13 s with an accuracy of 98.75%. Of the list of 685  genes in the feature selected 27K dataset, 578 were mapped to Ensemble Gene IDs.  This reduced set was significantly (FDR < 0.05) enriched in five biological  processes and one molecular function. Of the list of 1572 genes in the feature  selected 450K data set, 1290 were mapped to Ensemble Gene IDs. This reduced set  was significantly (FDR < 0.05) enriched in 95 biological processes and 17  molecular functions. Seven oncogene/tumor suppressor genes were common between  the 27K and 450K feature selected gene sets. These genes were RTN4IP1, MYO18B,  ANP32A, BRF1, SETBP1, NTRK1, and IGF2R. Our bioinformatics deep learning  workflow, incorporating imputation and data balancing methods, is able to  identify important methylation markers related to functionally important genes  in breast cancer with high accuracy compared to deep learning or statistical  models alone.

Constitutional LZTR1 or SMARCB1 pathogenic variants (PVs) have been found in  ∼86% of familial and ∼40% of sporadic schwannomatosis cases. Hence, we performed  massively parallel sequencing of the entire LZTR1, SMARCB1, and NF2 genomic loci  in 35 individuals with schwannomas negative for constitutional first-hit PVs in  the LZTR1/SMARCB1/NF2 coding sequences; however, with 22q deletion and/or a  different NF2 PV in each tumor, including six cases with only one tumor  available. Furthermore, we verified whether any other LZTR1/SMARCB1/NF2 (likely)  PVs could be found in 16 cases carrying a SMARCB1 constitutional variant in the  3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) c.*17C>T, c.*70C>T, or c.*82C>T. As no  additional variants were found, functional studies were performed to clarify the  effect of these 3'-UTR variants on the transcript. The 3'-UTR variants c.*17C>T  and c.*82C>T showed pathogenicity by negatively affecting the SMARCB1 transcript  level. Two novel deep intronic SMARCB1 variants, c.500+883T>G and c.500+887G>A,  resulting in out-of-frame missplicing of intron 4, were identified in two  unrelated individuals. Further resequencing of the entire repeat-masked genomics  sequences of chromosome 22q in individuals negative for PVs in the  SMARCB1/LZTR1/NF2 coding- and noncoding regions revealed five potential  schwannomatosis-predisposing candidate genes, that is, MYO18B, NEFH, SGSM1,  SGSM3, and SBF1, pending further verification.  © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AIMS: Left atrial (LA) volume and function impose significant impact on  cardiovascular pathogenesis if compromised. We aimed at investigating the  genetic architecture of LA volume and function using cardiac magnetic resonance  imaging data. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the UK Biobank, which is a large prospective  population study with available phenotypic and genetic data. On a subset of 35  658 European individuals, we performed genome-wide association studies on five  volumetric and functional LA variables, generated using a machine learning  algorithm. In total, we identified 18 novel genetic loci, mapped to genes with  known roles in cardiomyopathy (e.g. MYO18B, TTN, DSP, ANKRD1) and arrhythmia  (e.g. TTN, CASQ2, MYO18B, C9orf3). We observed high genetic correlation between  LA volume and function and stroke, which was most pronounced for LA passive  emptying fraction (rg = 0.40, P = 4 × 10-6). To investigate whether the genetic  risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with LA traits that precede overt  AF, we produced a polygenetic risk score for AF. We found that polygenetic risk  for AF is associated with increased LA volume and decreased LA function in  participants without AF [LAmax 0.25 (mL/m2)/standard deviation (SD), 95%  confidence interval (CI) (0.15; 0.36), P = 5.13 × 10-6; LAmin 0.21 (mL/m2)/SD,  95% CI (0.15; 0.28), P = 1.86 × 10-10; LA active emptying fraction -0.35%/SD,  95% CI (-0.43; -0.26), P = 3.14 × 10-14]. CONCLUSION: We report on 18 genetic loci associated with LA volume and function  and show evidence for several plausible candidate genes important for LA  structure.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Background: Hearing loss remains an important global health problem that is  potentially addressed through early identification of a genetic etiology, which  helps to predict outcomes of hearing rehabilitation such as cochlear  implantation and also to mitigate the long-term effects of comorbidities. The  identification of variants for hearing loss and detailed descriptions of  clinical phenotypes in patients from various populations are needed to improve  the utility of clinical genetic screening for hearing loss. Methods: Clinical  and exome data from 15 children with hearing loss were reviewed. Standard tools  for annotating variants were used and rare, putatively deleterious variants were  selected from the exome data. Results: In 15 children, 21 rare damaging variants  in 17 genes were identified, including: 14 known hearing loss or  neurodevelopmental genes, 11 of which had novel variants; and three candidate  genes IST1, CBLN3 and GDPD5, two of which were identified in children with both  hearing loss and enlarged vestibular aqueducts. Patients with variants within  IST1 and MYO18B had poorer outcomes after cochlear implantation. Conclusion: Our  findings highlight the importance of identifying novel variants and genes in  ethnic groups that are understudied for hearing loss.

Objective To summarize clinical characteristics and investigate possible  pathogenic gene of Klippel-Feil syndrome(KFS)by the self-designed multigene  panel sequencing,so as to decipher the molecular basis for early diagnosis and  targeted therapy.Methods From January 2015 to December 2018,we consecutively  recruited 25 patients who were diagnosed with KFS in Peking Union Medical  College Hospital.The demographic information,clinical manifestations,physical  examination and radiological assessments were analyzed.Multigene panel  sequencing was performed after DNA extraction from peripheral blood.The possible  pathogenic mutations of KFS were explored on the basis of bioinformatics  analysis.Results The KFS cohort consisted of 25 patients,including 15 males and  10 females,with a mean age of(12.9±7.3)years.Limited cervical range of motion  was the most common clinical feature(12 cases,48%).Based on the Samartzis  classification,the proportion of patients suffered from short neck(P=0.031)and  limited cervical range of motion(P=0.026)in type Ⅲ KFS was significantly higher  than that in type Ⅱ and type Ⅰ KFS.Panel sequencing detected a total of 11  pathogenic missense mutations in eight patients,including  COL6A1,COL6A2,CDAN1,GLI3,FLNB,CHRNG,MYH3,POR,and TNXB.There was no pathogenic  mutation found in five reported pathogenic genes(GDF6,MEOX1,GDF3,MYO18B and  RIPPLY2)associated with KFS.Conclusions Our study has shown that patients with  multiple contiguous cervical fusions are more likely to manifest short  neck,limited cervical range of motion,and clinical triad.Therefore,these  patients need additional attention and follow-up.Our analysis highlights novel  KFS-related genetic variants,such as COL6A and CDAN1,extending the spectrum of  known mutations contributing to this syndrome and providing a basis for  elucidating the pathogenesis of KFS.

Myosin-18 family, including  myosin-18A and myosin-18B, belongs to an unconventional class of myosin, which  lacks ATPase motor activity, and the investigations on their functions and  molecular mechanisms in vertebrate development and diseases have just been  initiated in recent years. Myosin-18A is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian  cells, whereas myosin-18B shows strong enrichment in striated muscles. Myosin-18  family is important for cell motility, sarcomere formation, and mechanosensing,  mostly by interacting with other cytoskeletal proteins and cellular apparatus.  Myosin-18A participates in several intracellular transport processes, such as  Golgi trafficking, and has multiple roles in focal adhesions, stress fibers, and  lamellipodia formation. Myosin-18B, on the other hand, participates in  actomyosin alignment and sarcomere assembly, thus relating to cell migration and  muscle contractility. Mutations of either Myo18a or Myo18b cause cardiac  developmental defects in mouse, emphasizing their crucial role in muscle  development and cardiac diseases. In this review, we revisit the discovery  history of myosin-18s and summarize the evolving understanding of the molecular  functions of myosin-18A and myosin-18B, with an emphasis on their separate yet  closely related functions in cell motility and contraction. Moreover, we discuss  the diseases tightly associated with myosin-18s, especially cardiovascular  defects and cancer, as well as highlight the unanswered questions and potential  future research perspectives on myosin-18s.

BACKGROUND: Myosin18 family, including Myosin18A (MYO18A) and Myosin18B  (MYO18B), are newly-identified Myosins in Myosin superfamily. The expression and  function of Myosin18 family in cancer progression is still controversial, and in  cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC) is totally unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and prognostic significance of Myosin18  family in cSCC. METHODS: In this study, the expressions of MYO18 family, including MYO18A and  MYO18B were detected in six pairs of cSCCs and corresponding normal tissues with  qRT-PCR. MYO18A and MYO18B expressions and intracellular locations in 80 cSCCs  were detected with immunohistochemistry. The clinical significance was evaluated  by analyzing the correlation between MYO18 family and clinicopathological  factors. The prognostic significance of MYO18 family was estimated by univariate  analysis with log-rank test, and by multivariate analysis by Cox-regression  model. RESULTS: The percentages of high MYO18A and MYO18B in cSCC were 43.75% and  36.25%, respectively. High expression of MYO18A (P = 0.035) and MYO18B  (P = 0.032) were both associated with less tumor size. MYO18A had no significant  influence on sSCC prognosis (P = 0.686), but low expression of MYO18B was proved  to be significantly associated with poor outcome of cSCC (P = 0.014). MYO18B was  confirmed as an independent prognostic biomarker of cSCC (P = 0.002), indicating  the favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: The expression of MYO18B was an independent prognostic biomarker of  cSCC, predicting the favorable prognosis independently. Investigating the  expression of MYO18B can help stratify the subset of high-risk cSCC patients for  more potent treatment and post-operational surveillance.

Klippel-Feil syndrome 4 (KFS4; MIM# 616549) is an autosomal recessive disorder  caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in MYO18B and comprises, in addition to  Klippel-Feil anomaly (KFA), nemaline myopathy, facial dysmorphism, and short  stature. We aim to outline the natural history of KFS4 and provide an updated  description of its clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular findings.  We comprehensively analyzed the medical records of 6 Saudi and 1 American  patients (including 5 previously unpublished cases) with a molecularly confirmed  diagnosis of KFS4. All patients had myopathy of varying severity that followed a  slowly progressive or non-progressive course, affecting primarily the proximal  musculature of the lower limb although hand involvement with distal  arthrogryposis and abnormal interphalangeal creases was also observed. KFA and  characteristic dysmorphic features, including ptosis and bulbous nose, were  observed in all but two patients. The causal MYO18B variants were a founder  NM_032608.5:c.6905C>A; p.(Ser2302*) variant in the Saudi patients (P1-P6) and a  novel MYO18B homozygous variant (c.6660_6670del;p.[Arg2220Serfs*74]) in the  American Caucasian patient (P7). We report the phenotypic and genetic findings  in seven patients with KFS4. We describe the natural history of this disease,  confirm myopathy as a universal feature and describe its pattern and  progression, and note interesting differences between the phenotypes observed in  patients with KFA and those without.  © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Despite the widespread use of cell-free DNA in screening for trisomy 21, soft  markers continue to be assessed in the second trimester, leading to confusion  about how they affect the risk of trisomy 21, especially after an earlier  screening test such as cell-free DNA screening. In this review, we provide an  overview of commonly used second trimester soft markers, explain how they can be  used to calculate the risk for trisomy 21, and discuss what other chromosomal or  structural abnormalities might be associated with these markers. We especially  focus on pathogenic copy number variants as these, in aggregate, are common and  are very difficult to detect using cfDNA or even standard karyotyping.  © 2025. The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare, demyelinating,  autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in the  arylsulfatase A enzyme (ASA), which is encoded by ARSA gene. A lack of ASA  activity results in an accumulation of sulfatides in the myelin sheaths of both  the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to developmental and  neurocognitive progressive deterioration that can be observed in all age groups. METHODS: We present a total of 9 patients with MLD with an average age of 61  months, whose clinical, laboratory and cranial magnetic resonance imaging  findings were evaluated, and who underwent an ARSA gene molecular analysis. RESULTS: Of the 9 patients, 7 had the late infantile form of the condition, 2  had the juvenile form, and 3 were identified through family screening. The  median age at diagnosis was 30 months (min 3-max 73 months), the mean ASA  activity value was 2 nmol/h/mgprt and the median cranial MR imaging severity  score was 10 (min 5-max 18). The grey and white matter volumes of all patients,  evaluated using volBrain software, were within the normal range. At an average  age of 48 months, the late-infantile MLD patients were unable to control any  body part. CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a treatment option  for both the juvenile and adult forms of MLD in asymptomatic or early  symptomatic patients, was performed on two of the asymptomatic and early  symptomatic patients, and post-HSCT ASA activity settled within the normal range  and their developmental milestones stabilized. It is important to diagnose MLD  in the asymptomatic period and newborn screening can support early diagnosis.  © 2024 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a fatal lysosomal storage disease  characterized by the deficient enzymatic activity of arylsulfatase A (ARSA).  Combined autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantion (HSCT) with lentiviral  (LV)-based gene therapy has great potential to treat MLD. Achieving the optimal  balance between high enzyme production for therapeutic efficacy and maintaining  a low vector copy number (VCN) is crucial. Insufficient enzyme levels can lead  to the progression of motor symptoms, undermining treatment goals. Conversely,  elevated VCN increases the risk of genotoxicity, which poses safety concerns,  and contributes to higher production costs, making the therapy less accessible.  Striking this balance is essential to maximize clinical benefit while minimizing  risks and costs. To address this need, we increased the expression of ARSA cDNA  at single integration by generating novel LVs, optimizing ARSA expression and  enhancing safety. In addition, our vectors achieved optimal transduction in  mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with minimal multiplicity of  infection (MOI). Our top-performing vector (EA1) showed at least 4× more ARSA  activity than the currently US and European Union (EU)-approved vector and a  superior ability to secrete vesicle-associated ARSA, a critical modality to  transfer functional enzymes from microglia to oligodendrocytes. Three-month-old  Arsa-knockout (KO) MLD mice transplanted with Arsa-KO bone marrow (BM) cells  transduced with 0.6 VCN of EA1 demonstrated behavior and CNS histology matching  wild-type (WT) mice. Our novel vector boosts efficacy while improving safety as  a robust approach for treating MLD patients.  © 2025 The Authors.

The present study investigated the effects of treatments with sulfatase to  desulfate the sulfated carbohydrate chain residues of the zona pellucida (ZP)  and arylsulfatase A-blocking peptide (ARSA-BP) for the specific masking of sperm  ARSA on the interaction of sperm ARSA with ZP, which plays an important role in  the in vitro fertilization (IVF) of porcine oocytes. The pretreatment of oocytes  with sulfatase for 10 min before the onset of insemination or the addition of  5 ng/mL ARSA-BP to IVF medium significantly reduced the incidence of polyspermy;  however, these treatments did not affect sperm penetrability or male pronucleus  formation. Combined treatments with sulfatase plus ARSA-BP significantly reduced  the incidence of polyspermy to the range of 23-26 % under conditions maintaining  a high sperm penetration rate from that of untreated oocytes (56 %). Although  the treatments with sulfatase or ARSA-BP alone and sulfatase plus ARSA-BP during  IVF did not affect the number of sperm that bound to the ZP or ZP solubility,  the incidence of sperm with the acrosome reaction that bound to the ZP was  efficiently reduced by the treatment. In oocytes treated with ARSA-BP but not  sulfatase, developmental potency to the blastocyst stage was enhanced by  decreasing the number of apoptotic blastomeres. Therefore, the present results  clearly indicate that interference with the interaction between sperm ARSA and  sulfated ZP glycoprotein residues reduced the induction of the acrosome reaction  in sperm that bound to the ZP, effectively suppressing polyspermy during porcine  IVF.

Convergent Pathways Identified for Cannabis Use Disorder Across Diverse Ancestry  Populations.  Peng Q, Wilhelmsen KC, Ehlers CL.  Large disparities in the prevalence of cannabis use disorder (CUD) exist across  ethnic groups in the U.S. Despite large GWAS meta-analyses identifying numerous  genome-wide significant loci for CUD in European descents, little is known about  other ethnic groups. While most GWAS and SNP-heritability studies focus on  common genomic variants, rare and low-frequency variants, particularly those  altering proteins, are known to be enriched for the heritability of complex  traits and may contribute to disease in different ways across populations,  either through converging or alternative pathways. In this study, we examined  three populations including European Americans (EA) and two understudied  populations: American Indians (AI) and Mexican Americans (MA). We focused on  rare and low frequency functional variants in genes and pathways, and performed  association analysis with CUD severity. We identified 10 significant loci in AI,  the ARSA gene in MA, three significant pathways in MA, and one in EA associated  with CUD severity. Notably, pathways related to arylsulfatases activation and  heparan sulfate degradation were supported by both EA and MA, with additional  evidence from AI. The integrin beta-1 cell surface interaction pathway, involved  in cell adhesion, was uniquely significant in MA. Several immune-related  pathways were also found, including an autoimmune condition significant in MA  with evidence from EA as well, and a p38-gamma/delta mediated signaling pathway  supported across all three cohorts. Although each population displayed distinct  pathways linked to CUD, overlapping genes in top pathways suggested shared  genetic factors, further highlighting the importance of considering diverse  populations in genetic research on cannabis use disorder.

BACKGROUND: Sulfatides are a class of sphingolipids which are abundant in the  myelin sheet and oligodendrocytes, therefore they play a crucial role in the  nervous system. Abnormal sulfatide excretion has been linked to several  neurodegenerative disorders including metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and  multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD). In MLD and MSD, sulfatide catabolism is  impaired due to the reduced lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity resulting  in an accumulation of sulfatides, which can be useful in a diagnostic setting.  The current study aims to develop a method for semi-quantitation of urine  sulfatides as a diagnostic tool for MLD and MSD. RESULTS: We developed a sensitive and accurate method for identifying 48 urinary  molecular sulfatide species by UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS analysis. Newborns were  classified according to their gestational age. The proportion of sulfatides  bearing saturated fatty acids attached to d18:1 and d18:0 sulfatide backbone was  higher in newborns and increased with prematurity. The 5 most abundant sulfatide  species in all samples (controls, MLD and MSD) were C22:0, C24:0, C22:0-OH,  C24:0-OH and C24:1-OH fatty acid attached to d18:1 sulfatide backbone. The top  discriminant feature between MLD patients and controls was d18:1/C26:1-OH. Total  semi-quantitation of 6 sulfatide species (5 most abundant  sulfatides + d18:1/C26:1-OH) shows that overall excretion gradually decreases  with age and all MLD patients were successfully discriminated from their  age-matched controls. While sulfatide excretion was increased in the severe MSD  patients (n = 2), it was normal in the attenuated MSD patients, who had high  residual ARSA activity. SIGNIFICANCE: This study proves the feasibility of diagnosing MLD and severe MSD  based on sulfatide excretion in urine. We established (gestational) age-specific  cut-offs of the total sulfatide excretion and composition. Interpretation of the  composition (e.g. by calculation the ratio  (d18:1/C22:0+d18:1/C24:0)/(d18:1/C22:0-OH + d18:1/C24:0-OH)) may reduce false  positives, especially when sampling at young age.

Background/Objectives: This study aimed to provide a descriptive review of fetal  aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), with a discussion of the genomic and  structural anatomy and perinatal prognosis in our hospital's obstetric  department. Methods: In total, 3266 fetal level II sonographies were performed  between January 2020 and June 2023. The 21 cases diagnosed with ARSA were  included in this study. Obstetric ultrasound screening, noninvasive prenatal  screening, and fetal karyotyping were performed. Fetal echocardiograms,  postnatal information, and follow-up data were recorded. Results: In our dataset  of 3266 cases, the overall incidence rate of ARSA was 0.6%. Of the 21 fetuses  with ARSA, no abnormalities were detected in either prenatal or genetic tests,  and no chromosomal anomalies were identified. Conclusions: Our study provides  informative insights into ARSA, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive  evaluation of its structural and genetic aspects. The findings of this study  prompt further exploration, especially regarding the increasing incidence of  ARSA and the potential role of advanced genetic analyses in enhancing diagnostic  precision and fetal prognostic evaluation.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major threat to health with  significant global economic and safety implications. One of the major drives of  this resistance is the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials.  Background/Objectives: In this sense, WHO proposed to it members to estimate the  antimicrobial consumption (AMC) at each country level, in order to help local  authorities in their decision making related to AMR control. Although this  program is already installed worldwide, in the American continent, the rate of  countries' inclusion has been delayed. This paper describes the efforts of Latin  American & Caribbean countries in terms of AMC local assessment. Methods: AMC  data collection was done as per the GLASS tool proposed by WHO. Analysis was  performed using Daily Defined Dose each one thousand inhabitants day (DID) for  global, therapeutical group or each antibiotic. Access, Watch and target Reserve  (AWaRe) WHO classification was applied after data collection. Results: 13  countries were included during the period 2019-2022. The global DID ranged from  2.55 DID to 36.26 DID. The trend of this consumption did downward along the  years. One of the factors than impacted the AMC was the COVID-19 pandemic. The  most problematic antimicrobial misuse was seen in certain beta lactams and  macrolides, like ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Regarding the AWaRe  classification, 5 out of 13 countries accomplished the target until 2023 of 60%  consumption for ""Access antimicrobial's group by 2023). This data helped local  health managers to propose changes for better control of the AMR problem  (ceftriaxone usage limitations in Peru, antimicrobial law in Argentina, etc.).  Conclusions: The first steps towards AMC country's assessment has been  initiated. The present work provided essential inputs to local health  authorities for decision making related to AMR control. It will be necessary to  keep applying this results in regulate antibiotic usage at country level, as  well as enrolling more countries in the AMC project.

BACKGROUND: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disorder  caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Accumulation of sulfatide,  substrate of ARSA, in the central and peripheral nervous system causes  neurodegeneration, which leads to neurologic and psychiatric symptoms.  Adult-onset MLD is the least frequent type of MLD and shows both genetic and  clinical heterogeneity. The clinical presentation differs according to  pathogenic variants in the ARSA gene. Therefore, establishing genotype-phenotype  correlation is crucial for the diagnosis and management of patients with  adult-onset MLD. METHODS: A family of multiple individuals with adult-onset psychomotor  deterioration was assessed. The patients had behavioral disturbances initially,  and neurological deficits had developed in the later stages of the disease. The  family was analyzed using karyotype analysis, Sanger sequencing, custom  next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of the genes related to dementia, and  whole exome sequencing (WES). RESULTS: Karyotype analysis and NGS dementia panel showed no pathogenic  aberration. However, WES analysis revealed heterozygous variants in the ARSA  gene: c.542T>G (p.Ile181Ser) and c.661T>A (p.Phe221Ile). Segregation analysis,  performed by Sanger sequencing, showed that all individuals with the same  clinical findings were compound heterozygous for c.542T>G and c.661T>A  substitutions. CONCLUSION: The compound heterozygosity of c.542T>G and c.661T>A variants of the  ARSA gene cause adult-onset MLD. The genotype detected in the patients was not  reported before in the literature. Moreover, the clinical course of the patients  followed a similar pattern with dominantly psychiatric symptoms at the initial  stage of the disease, indicating a distinct phenotype caused by the two  pathogenic variants of the ARSA gene.

Author information: (1)Anatomy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens School of Medicine,  Athens, GRC.  An aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), a congenital vascular anomaly, can  cause significant esophageal compression, leading to a condition known as  dysphagia lusoria (DL). We present the case of a 44-year-old man with  progressively worsening dysphagia and odynophagia over the last six months,  resulting in severe weight loss and dietary restrictions. Imaging techniques  revealed esophageal stenosis caused by external compression from an ARSA arising  from the posterior wall of the distal aortic arch, accompanied by a Kommerell's  diverticulum. Computed tomography angiography confirmed the aberrant origin,  retroesophageal course, and vascular anomaly. Although surgical intervention  involving ligation and excision of the retroesophageal artery segment with a  right carotid-subclavian bypass was recommended, the patient opted for  conservative management. This case highlights the importance of advanced imaging  techniques in diagnosing DL and guiding treatment decisions. Regular follow-up  remains essential to monitor disease progression and manage potential  complications.  Copyright © 2025, Galanis et al.

Case Report: Beware of arteria lusoria: a potential risk factor in esophagectomy  surgery.  Liu Q(1).  Author information: (1)Department of Thoracic Surgery, Nanbu County People's Hospital, Nanchong  City, Sichuan, China.  The aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), also known as lusoria artery, is a  relatively rare vascular malformation influencing 0.6% to 1.4% of the  population, and this figure elevates exponentially to 26%-34% among  Down-syndrome individuals. However, few cases are available on esophageal cancer  associated with ARSA. Here, we report a 30-year-old male esophageal cancer  patient with arteria lusoria, which elevated surgical risks in esophagectomy. We  reviewed the key points of anatomy and further complications to understand this  vascular anomaly in esophagectomy. This report aims to raise awareness among  thoracic surgeons and radiologists about the importance of thorough preoperative  assessment and the unique challenges posed by ARSA in esophageal cancer surgery.  © 2025 Liu.

As one of the most abundant microorganisms on Earth, Bathyarchaeia with diverse  abilities to degrade complex organic carbon play a vital role in the global  carbon cycle. However, the role of Bathyarchaeia in arsenic (As) metabolism and  their contribution to As mobilization in aquifers remain unclear. In this study,  we recovered 15 Bathyarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from  metagenomes of borehole sediments in the Jianghan Plain (JHP), China. Together  with 374 representative Bathyarchaeia MAGs from public databases, six As  metabolism genes i.e. arrA, arsR, arsA, arsB, arsC (Trx) and arsM were  identified, accounting for 4.4, 47.6, 20.3, 38.3, 37.5 and 49.4 % of total  Bathyarchaeia MAGs, respectively. Heterologous expression of multiple arsC and  arsM genes of Bathyarchaeia MAGs obtained from JHP sediments validated their  abilities for As(V) reduction and As(III) methylation at environmentally  relevant As concentration. These results indicate that in addition to providing  bioavailable carbon sources for other microbial functional populations,  Bathyarchaeia directly participate in As mobilization in the JHP aquifer via  As(V) reduction and As(III) methylation. The diversified distribution of arsC  and arsM in the class Bathyarchaeia suggests that Bathyarchaeia may contribute  to As cycling in other As-rich environments, such as hot spring, saline lakes,  marine hydrothermal sediments and soils.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the effectiveness of the P-Positive program  in addressing emotional aggression among junior high school students in Lopburi  Province, Thailand. METHODS: A quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design was employed  with 54 participants aged 13-15. The intervention, conducted over 16 weeks,  applied the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) framework. Key components  included emotional regulation, empathy development, and behavioral change,  facilitated through structured activities. Emotional intelligence was assessed  using the EQ Metric, evaluating nine dimensions comprehensively. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed across all  dimensions of emotional intelligence (p<0.001). The most notable improvements  were in self-control, empathy, and decision-making, with motivation showing the  highest mean difference (4.333). Inner peace exhibited the smallest mean  improvement (1.593), but the change was still statistically significant. These  findings highlight the program's effectiveness in enhancing emotional  intelligence and reducing aggression. CONCLUSIONS: The P-Positive program shows strong potential as a scalable  intervention for improving emotional well-being and mitigating aggression in  adolescents. It offers valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and public  health stakeholders, suggesting the importance of integrating such programs into  broader educational and health initiatives. Further refinements to address  specific dimensions like inner peace may enhance its impact.  © 2025 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.

Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal  disorder caused by ARSA gene variants, affecting central and peripheral nervous  systems. While ARSA variants are reported globally, data from sub-Saharan Africa  (SSA) are limited. We report the first SSA case, a Malian patient with a rare  phenotype: predominant tonic seizures without typical peripheral neuropathy  signs. The patient harbored a novel ARSA variant (c.191T > C; p.Phe64Ser),  predicted deleterious by in silico tools. This case expands the genetic and  phenotypic spectrum of MLD, underscoring the need for genetic studies in  underrepresented regions.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVE: Studies of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) in African children  are rare, but in Sudan, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and triple A  syndrome are the most common genetic causes. Differential diagnosis is  challenging, especially in resource-limited settings, where presentation can  mimic common childhood diseases and facilities for biochemical and genetic  testing may be restricted. DESIGN: Forty-eight patients from 43 families (31 male:17 female) with PAI were  included (CAH/triple A excluded). Additional features seen included white matter  changes on magnetic resonance imaging, auto-immune features, and/or obesity.  Sanger and whole exome sequencing (WES) were employed for diagnosis,  confirmation, and segregation with in vitro assays to investigate potential  splice defects. RESULTS: In 21/43 families, a genetic aetiology consistent with non-autoimmune  PAI was discovered, and in 3 families, autoimmune regulator (AIRE) mutations  were found, indicating an autoimmune origin. In Sudan, adenosine triphosphate  (ATP) binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1)/nicotinamide nucleotide  transhydrogenase (NNT)/AIRE mutations were commonest, including recurrent NNT  splice and AIRE deletion mutations. In 2 families, we identified ARSA mutations  fitting a diagnosis of metachromatic leucodystrophy (MLD), in which adrenal  insufficiency has not previously been described. In the remaining 17 families,  no causative gene mutations were found. Putative causal variants for  comorbidities were concomitantly detected. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, WES revealed itself as a useful frontline tool  for the differential diagnosis of individuals presenting with adrenal  insufficiency, including discrimination between MLD and adrenoleucodystrophy and  giving plausible gene defects for additional comorbidities such as obesity. Such  genetic diagnoses are crucial to design optimal treatment plans and for genetic  counselling in affected individuals and their families.  © The Author(s) 2025.

Continued advances in variant effect prediction are necessary to demonstrate the  ability of machine learning methods to accurately determine the clinical impact  of variants of unknown significance (VUS). Towards this goal, the ARSA Critical  Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) challenge was designed to  characterize progress by utilizing 219 experimentally assayed missense VUS in  the Arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene to assess the performance of community-submitted  predictions of variant functional effects. The challenge involved 15 teams, and  evaluated additional predictions from established and recently released models.  Notably, a model developed by participants of a genetics and coding bootcamp,  trained with standard machine-learning tools in Python, demonstrated superior  performance among submissions. Furthermore, the study observed that  state-of-the-art deep learning methods provided small but statistically  significant improvement in predictive performance compared to less elaborate  techniques. These findings underscore the utility of variant effect prediction,  and the potential for models trained with modest resources to accurately  classify VUS in genetic and clinical research.  © 2025.

The myelin is responsible for providing stability to the axons of the nerve  cells, but above all, to improve transmission speed of the nerve impulse in  vertebrates. Over 70% of the myelin sheath is composed of lipids and the  remaining portion by approximately 2,000 proteins. The myelin sheath has been  constantly evolving, and it is known that unusually high concentrations of  galactosylceramide (GalCer) and its sulfated form play a major role in the  biophysical properties of the myelin. To gain insights of the evolutionary role  of GalCer, we have studied two lysosomal enzymes involved in GalCer degradation,  arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and galactocerebrosidase (GALC). Deficiency of ARSA or  GALC causes demyelinating disorders. We conducted phylogenetic analyses of 105  ARSA and 110 GALC orthologs representing more than 600 million years ago of  evolution. We examined i) low values of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous  nucleotide-substitution rates (dN/dS) indicating purifying selection and ii)  negative selection of amino acids located in the active site preventing  pathogenic mutations. Gene structure analyses showed evidence of rearrangement  with gain and loss of exons while there were conserved regions mainly located  around the active site. We also found a limited number of sites under positive  selection pressure that do not cause alterations to the overall protein  structure. Our results indicate that ARSA and GALC have been highly conserved  during the evolutionary process to maintain the metabolism of GalCer, which is  essential for the integrity of the white matter in vertebrate species.

Aneurysms of an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) are rare but constitute  a potentially lethal condition, especially with concomitant Marfan syndrome  (MFS). A 27-year-old female with confirmed MFS presented with a relevant  progression of a known aneurysm of an ARSA in MRI. The patient had undergone  valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) 4 months prior. After  interdisciplinary discussion, she underwent endovascular exclusion of the  aneurysm using a combination of established vascular plugs and novel shape  memory polymer embolization plugs to fill the large ARSA aneurysm volume. The  shape memory polymer embolization plugs expand in the vessel to a porous  scaffold, designed to support thrombus formation throughout its structure. The  polymer is also radiolucent, which minimizes artefact and facilitates follow-up  imaging. Development of a strategy for the treatment of ARSA aneurysms is  challenging and different surgical, endovascular, and combined approaches have  been published. Interdisciplinary discussion is crucial to minimize the overall  risk and trauma. In our case of a young female and new mother, an endovascular  approach was successfully and safely performed. The future need for surgery due  to concomitant MFS is expected.  © The Author(s) 2025. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the  British Institute of Radiology.

The present study evaluated the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant  isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) including methicillin-resistant S.  aureus (MRSA), β-lactam-resistant S. aureus (BRSA), aminoglycoside-resistant S.  aureus (ARSA), and tetracycline-resistant S. aureus (TRSA) from the udder of  dromedary camels along with the associated risk factors and the antibiogram of  resistant isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of antibiotic-resistant genes with  NCBI sequences was performed to check their homology. A total of 384 milk  samples were collected and subjected to standard microbiological procedures to  isolate S. aureus. The results revealed that 177 milk samples were found  positive for subclinical mastitis (SCM) out of which 101 milk samples were found  positive for S. aureus. The molecular assay found the prevalence of MRSA, BRSA,  ARSA, and TRSA as 48.51 %, 46.53 %, 42.57 %, and 39.60 % by targeting the mecA,  blaZ, accA-aphD, and tetK genes respectively. The study isolates significant  similarities to each other and to previously reported sequences from other  countries that were found by in-silico analysis, indicating the possibility of  pathogen transboundary transmission. This study also revealed potential risk  factors that aid in the spread of mastitis in camels. Among various risk  factors, the most significant were farm hygiene, physiological status of  animals, type of mastitis, teat injury, use of teat dips, and milk leakage  (p < 0.05). The antibiogram of antibiotic-resistant isolates of S. aureus  revealed that the highest resistance was observed against penicillin followed by  amoxicillin and oxytetracycline while levofloxacin was the most sensitive drug.  This study highlights the high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus  in camel mastitis. Identified risk factors provide valuable insights into  management practices that contribute to disease occurrence, aiding in the  development of targeted control strategies. Additionally, antimicrobial  susceptibility findings offer guidance for optimizing treatment protocols to  effectively manage S. aureus-induced mastitis in camels and mitigate the spread  of antimicrobial resistance.

Investigating phase coupling of respiratory sinus arrhythmia and slow wave sleep  in obstructive sleep apnea patients with and without depression.  Alzaabi Y(1), Khandoker AH(2).

Electronic address: Ahsan.Khandoker@ku.ac.ae.  Phase coherence (λ) between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and respiration  has emerged as a promising metric for assessing the role of autonomic nervous  system (ANS) activity and slow wave sleep (SWS) activities in healthy subjects.  This study aims to investigate how λ and SWS activity differ between Obstructive  Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients with and without major depressive disorder (MDD)  during overnight sleep and explore whether the correlation between λ and SWS  activity exists among those OSA patients compared to healthy individuals.  Overnight electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiograms (ECG), and breathing  using plethysmography were recorded from 104 subjects, including 35 healthy  individuals (control), 34 OSA subjects with MDD (OSAD+) and 35 OSA subjects  without MDD (OSAD+). Slow wave activity was computed by the amplitude envelope  of the EEG δ-wave (0.5-4 Hz). The interbeat intervals (RRI) and respiratory  movement were derived from ECG. RRI and respiration were resampled at a  frequency of 10 Hz, and the band passed filtered within the range of 0.1-0.4 Hz  before the Hilbert transform was used to extract instantaneous phases of the RSA  and respiration. From the analytical signal of the Hilbert transform, the phase  coherence (λ) and amplitude of RSA (ARSA) were quantified. Additionally, the  heart rate variability (HRV) features were calculated. Our results showed that  overnight λ was significantly greater, while the Low Frequency (LF) and High  Frequency (HF) components of the HRV were significantly lower in OSAD+ compared  to OSAD-. In addition, overnight δ-wave activity was greater in OSAD- compared  to both OSAD+ and control groups. Using auto- and cross-correlation analyses, we  found that overnight profiles of λ and δ-wave were correlated only in healthy  individuals compared to OSAD+ and OSAD-, indicating that sleep apnea may only  have an impact on this cortical-cardiorespiratory correlation rather than  depression. Our findings suggest that λ and SWS activity appear to be biomarkers  for assessing depression in OSA patients, whereas their correlation pattern may  serve as a marker for only OSA. This could enhance diagnostic precision and  provide valuable insights into the complex physiological mechanisms underlying  the corambid of OSA and MDD.  Copyright © 2025.

Biterge Sut B(1).  Author information: (1)Faculty of Science and Letters, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics,  Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Türkiye.  BACKGROUND: Neural tube formation is one of the most important developmental  events as it gives rise to the key organs comprising the central nervous system.  Failure in the proper closure of the neural tube results in congenital  abnormalities, namely neural tube defects (NTDs). Previous studies have  identified several single nucleotide variations that are considered risk factors  and established a genetic background for the increased incidence of NTDs and  factors. This study aims to provide a comprehensive functional analysis of  NTD-related missense mutations in terms of their potential effects on  pathogenicity, protein stability, and structure using predictive in silico  analysis tools. METHODS: Single nucleotide variations associated with NTD risk were identified  by a systematic review of previous studies on Pubmed and ClinVar. Protein  stability and pathogenicity scores were predicted using MUpro and PloyPhen2,  respectively. Structural alterations were determined via the HOPE server.  Predicted expression profiles in the brain were retrieved from the Human Protein  Atlas. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 43 NTD-related missense mutations in MTHFR,  MTRR, PARD3, PACS1, MED12, VANGL1, VANGL2, FZD6, CELSR1, FUZ, DVL2, and LRP6  genes. We found that all of these genes are predicted to be expressed in  different regions of the brain. We showed that single nucleotide variations  resulted in decreased protein stability, and the majority of them were found to  be damaging. We also report that the amino acid changes introduced by these  mutations caused differences in size, charge, and hydrophobicity, which  potentially resulted in structural alterations within the protein and affected  their contacts with other proteins and ligands. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of  NTD-related missense mutations regarding their potential damaging effects, which  might contribute to the pathogenesis of NTDs.  © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Tumor progression is suppressed by inherent cellular mechanisms such as  apoptosis. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most commonly mutated gene in  human cancer and plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression. RPRM is a target  gene of p53 known to be involved in tumor suppression, but its molecular  function has remained elusive. Here, we report that Reprimo (the protein product  of RPRM) is secreted and extrinsically induces apoptosis in recipient cells. We  identified FAT1, FAT4, CELSR1, CELSR2, and CELSR3, members of the protocadherin  family, as receptors for Reprimo. Subsequent analyses revealed that Reprimo acts  upstream of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ-p73 axis and induces apoptosis by transactivating  various proapoptotic genes. In vivo analyses further support the  tumor-suppressive effects of secreted Reprimo. These findings identify the  p53-Reprimo-Hippo-YAP/TAZ-p73 axis as an extrinsic apoptosis pathway that plays  a crucial role in tumor suppression. Our finding of the innate tumor eliminator  Reprimo and the downstream pathway offers a promising avenue for the  pharmacological treatment of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is a rare disorder characterized by a  triad of yellow dystrophic nails, lymphedema, and chronic lung disease. Most  patients present in adulthood, with only a few congenital or familial cases  described. The cause of YNS remains largely unknown, although defects in  lymphatic vessel development are suggested to play a significant role. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying YNS. DESIGN: Analysis of genetic sequencing data and gene and protein expression  studies. SETTING: A tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS: 6 patients with congenital YNS (cYNS) and 5 with sporadic YNS (sYNS). MEASUREMENTS: Exome and genome sequencing were used to detect disease-causing  variants, complemented by RNA analyses for intronic variants. Protein and gene  expressions were studied by immunofluorescence staining and real-time reverse  transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. RESULTS: Biallelic variants in CELSR1 (n = 5) or likely FZD6 (n = 1), both core  molecules in the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, were identified in all  patients with cYNS; none of the patients with sYNS had candidate genetic  variants. Immunofluorescence staining showed that CELSR1 colocalizes with  lymphatic vessels in the skin but not in the lungs or the intestine. Moreover,  levels of CELSR1 and FZD6 proteins were negligible to zero in patient tissues  (n = 2) compared with control tissues. Gene expression of Wnt/PCP-related genes  was reduced in patients with cYNS (n = 3), and patients with sYNS (n = 4) showed  milder gene expression impairments. LIMITATION: Small cohort size and limited sample availability. CONCLUSION: Defects in PCP organization may play a major role in the  pathogenesis of YNS. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration  of a mechanism explaining YNS development, mainly in its congenital form but  also in patients with sporadic disease.

Animal models of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) recapitulate the  pathological changes observed in human PTOA. Here, skeletally mature C57Bl6 mice  were subjected to either rapid-onset non-surgical mechanical rupture of the  anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or to surgical destabilisation of the medial  meniscus (DMM). Transcriptome profiling of micro-dissected cartilage at day 7 or  day 42 following ACL or DMM procedure, respectively, showed that the two models  were comparable and highly correlative. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis  identified similarly enriched pathways that were overrepresented by anabolic  terms. To address the transcriptome changes more completely in the ACL model, we  also performed small RNA sequencing, describing the first microRNA profile of  this model. miR-199-5p was amongst the most abundant, yet differentially  expressed, microRNAs, and its inhibition in primary human chondrocytes led to a  transcriptome response that was comparable to that observed in both human 'OA  damaged vs intact cartilage' and murine DMM cartilage datasets. We also  experimentally verified CELSR1, GIT1, ECE1 and SOS2 as novel miR-199-5p targets.  Together, these data support the use of the ACL rupture model as a non-invasive  companion to the DMM model.  © 2024. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

Breakthroughs in surgical and medical techniques have significantly improved  outcomes for children with congenital heart disease (CHD), but research  continues to address the ongoing challenge of organ dysfunction after surgery,  particularly in neonates and infants. Our study explored circular RNAs  (circRNAs) within plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in neonates and  infants undergoing CHD surgery. Post-surgery EV circRNAs showed dramatic  expression changes between organ dysfunction (OD) and control groups. Tissue  injury-related pathways were consistent across pre- and post-surgery in OD. The  top two significant predicted tissue sources of these circRNAs originated from  the respiratory system, aligning with the fact that all patients in the OD arm  experienced respiratory dysfunction. Five of these circRNAs, namely circ-CELSR1,  circ-PLXNA1, circ-OBSL1, circ-DAB2IP, and circ-KANK1, significantly correlated  with PELOD (Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction) score and demonstrated high  performance (AUC = 0.95), supporting the potential of circRNAs as prognostic  markers. These findings pave the way for EV circRNAs as promising tools for  managing post-surgical organ dysfunction and potentially guiding therapeutic  strategies in children with CHD.

Adult mammalian lungs exhibit a fractal pattern, as each successive generation  of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. Achieving this  structure likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the  embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in the adult. In  monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell  polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we characterized the roles of PCP complex  components in airway initiation, elongation and widening during branching  morphogenesis of the lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly  found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP complex  function in the lung epithelium. Instead, we found a previously unreported  Celsr1-independent role for the PCP complex components Vangl1 and Vangl2 in the  pulmonary mesenchyme, where they are required for branch initiation, elongation  and widening. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl1 and Vangl2  that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional  diversification of PCP complex components in vertebrate development. These data  also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the  fractal structure of airways in the mature lung.  © 2024. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

The planar cell polarity (PCP) complex is speculated to function in murine lung  development, where branching morphogenesis generates an epithelial tree whose  distal tips expand dramatically during sacculation. Here, we show that PCP is  dispensable in the airway epithelium for sacculation. Rather, we find a  Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme:  loss of Vangl1/2 inhibits mesenchymal thinning and expansion of the saccular  epithelium. Further, loss of mesenchymal Wnt5a mimics sacculation defects  observed in Vangl2-mutant lungs, implicating mesenchymal Wnt5a/Vangl signaling  as a key regulator of late lung morphogenesis. A computational model predicts  that sacculation requires a fluid mesenchymal compartment. Lineage-tracing and  cell-shape analyses are consistent with the mesenchyme acting as a fluid tissue,  suggesting that loss of Vangl1/2 impacts the ability of mesenchymal cells to  exchange neighbors. Our data thus identify an explicit function for Vangl and  the pulmonary mesenchyme in actively shaping the saccular epithelium.  Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study investigated associations of the Incredible Years (IY) parenting  program with children's DNA methylation. Participants were 289 Dutch children  aged 3-9 years (75% European ancestry, 48% female) with above-average conduct  problems. Saliva was collected 2.5 years after families were randomized to IY or  care as usual (CAU). Using an intention-to-treat approach, confirmatory  multiple-regression analyses revealed no significant differences between the IY  and CAU groups in children's methylation levels at the NR3C1 and FKBP5 genes.  However, exploratory epigenome-wide analyses revealed nine differentially  methylated regions between groups, coinciding with SLAMF1, MITF, FAM200B, PSD3,  SNX31, and CELSR1. The study provides preliminary evidence for associations of  IY with children's salivary methylation levels and highlights the need for  further research into biological outcomes of parenting programs.  © 2024 The Authors.

Rarely, chromosomal  rearrangements that spare SHANK3 share the same general phenotype (PMS-SHANK3  unrelated). Very recent human and model system studies of genes that likely  contribute to the PMS phenotype point to overlap in gene functions associated  with neurodevelopment, synaptic formation, stress/inflammation and regulation of  gene expression. In this review of recent findings, we describe the functional  overlaps between SHANK3 and six partner genes of 22q13.3 (PLXNB2, BRD1, CELSR1,  PHF21B, SULT4A1, and TCF20), which suggest a model that explains the commonality  between PMS-SHANK3 related and PMS-SHANK3 unrelated classes of PMS. These genes  are likely not the only contributors to neurodevelopmental impairments in the  region, but they are the best documented to date. The review provides evidence  for the overlapping and likely synergistic contributions of these genes to the  PMS phenotype.  © 2024 The Authors. Clinical Genetics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Structure of the extracellular region of the adhesion GPCR CELSR1 reveals a  compact module which regulates G protein-coupling.  Bandekar SJ, Garbett K, Kordon SP, Dintzner E, Shearer T, Sando RC, Araç D.  Cadherin EGF Laminin G seven-pass G-type receptors (CELSRs or ADGRCs) are  conserved adhesion G protein-coupled receptors which are essential for animal  development. CELSRs have extracellular regions (ECRs) containing 23 adhesion  domains which couple adhesion to intracellular signaling. However,  molecular-level insight into CELSR function is sparsely available. We report the  4.3 Å cryo-EM reconstruction of the mCELSR1 ECR with 13 domains resolved in the  structure. These domains form a compact module mediated by interdomain  interactions with contact between the N- and C-terminal domains. We show the  mCELSR1 ECR forms an extended species in the presence of Ca 2+ , which we  propose represents the antiparallel cadherin repeat dimer. Using assays for  adhesion and G protein-coupling, we assign the N-terminal CADH1-8 module as  necessary for cell adhesion and we show the C-terminal CAHD9-GAIN module  regulates signaling. Our work provides important molecular context to the  literature on CELSR function and opens the door towards further mechanistic  studies.

Electronic address: sotomayor.8@osu.edu.  Planar cell polarity (PCP), essential to multicellular developmental processes,  arises when cells polarize and align across tissues. Central to PCP is CELSR1,  an atypical cadherin featuring a long ectodomain with nine extracellular  cadherin (EC) repeats, a membrane adjacent domain (MAD10), and several  characteristic adhesion GPCR domains. Cell-based aggregation assays have  demonstrated CELSR1's homophilic adhesive nature, but mechanistic details are  missing. Here, we investigate the possible adhesive properties and structures of  CELSR1 EC repeats. Our bead aggregation assays do not support strong adhesion by  EC repeats alone. Consistently, EC1-4 only dimerizes at high concentration in  solution. Crystal structures of human CELSR1 EC1-4 and EC4-7 reveal typical  folds and a non-canonical linker between EC5 and EC6. Simulations and  experiments using EC4-7 indicate flexibility at EC5-6, and solution experiments  show EC7-MAD10-mediated dimerization. Our results suggest weak homophilic  adhesion by CELSR1 cadherin repeats and provide mechanistic insights into the  structural determinants of CELSR1 function.  Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

(#)Contributed equally  Fetal hydrops as detected by prenatal ultrasound usually carries a poor  prognosis depending on the underlying aetiology. We describe the prenatal and  postnatal clinical course of two unrelated female probands in whom de novo  heterozygous missense variants in the planar cell polarity gene CELSR1 were  detected using exome sequencing. Using several in vitro assays, we show that the  CELSR1 p.(Cys1318Tyr) variant disrupted the subcellular localisation, affected  cell-cell junction, impaired planar cell polarity signalling and lowered  proliferation rate. These observations suggest that deleterious rare CELSR1  variants could be a possible cause of fetal hydrops.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. No commercial re-use.

Cadherin epidermal growth factor and laminin-G seven-pass G-type receptor 1  (CELSR1) is a planar cell polarity protein involved in the transmission of  directional cues to align either individual cells within an epithelial sheet or  multicellular clusters. CELSR1 has been suggested to play a role in glioma,  breast cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia development; however, whether it  has a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer remains unknown. The aim of  this study was to determine the role of CELSR1 in ovarian cancer and elucidate  its underlying molecular mechanisms. By analyzing gene expression data  downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas database, we found that CELSR1  expression was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues compared to that in normal  ovarian tissues. High CELSR1 expression levels were associated with poor  prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. Cell proliferation, scratch, and  transwell assays revealed that CELSR1 promoted the proliferation, migration, and  invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. In addition, transcriptome sequencing  analysis revealed that CELSR1 knockdown in T29H cells resulted in the  dysregulation of the expression of 1320 genes. Further analysis revealed that  genes involved in proliferation- and migration-associated signaling pathways  were regulated by CELSR1. Our study demonstrates that CELSR1 is highly expressed  in ovarian cancer cells and regulates their proliferation and migration,  suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.  © 2023.

INTRODUCTION: Women with epilepsy (WWE) are more likely to develop reproductive  endocrine disorders, especially polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study  aimed to explore the genetic factors of PCOS in WWE in hope of improving  individual precision diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: WWE registered at West China Hospital between January 2022 and October  2022 were enrolled in this study. Demographic and epilepsy-related  characteristics were recorded, and blood samples were collected for hormones,  glucose metabolism testing, and whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: After sample sequencing, quality control, and variants selection,  association analyses were performed. Pathway analysis was performed to identify  involved biological pathways. The overall and PCOS ""burden score"" of each  individual were calculated to count the deleterious variants. A total of 95 WWE  were included in this study and 19 patients were diagnosed with PCOS. WWE with  PCOS showed a significantly different hormone profiles and a tendency of  impaired glucose metabolism. The most commonly associated genes were ZFYVE28,  COL19A1, SIK3, ANKK1, PPIG, and REPIN1. The top 3 canonical pathways are  adipogenesis pathway, epoxysqualene biosynthesis signaling, and glutamate  degradation signaling. The most significant common variant was rs11914038  located in gene CELSR1 and rs651748 located in gene ZBTB16. In human gene  connectome prioritizations, ITGA9, PNPLA2, and DAB2 are the top 3 genes having  the shortest distance to known PCOS genes. CONCLUSION: Genetic factors involved in the abnormal regulation of glucose and  insulin metabolism are likely to be associated with the comorbidity of PCOS in  WWE. Interventions targeting these processes should be given more priority in  clinical practice.  © 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel.

BACKGROUND: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by  SHANK3 pathogenic variants or chromosomal rearrangements affecting the  chromosome 22q13 region. Previous research found that kidney disorders,  primarily congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, are common in  people with PMS, yet research into candidate genes has been hampered by small  study sizes and lack of attention to these problems. METHODS: We used a cohort of 357 people from the Phelan-McDermid Syndrome  Foundation International Registry to investigate the prevalence of kidney  disorders in PMS using a cross-sectional design and to identify 22q13 genes  contributing to these disorders. RESULTS: Kidney disorders reported included vesicoureteral reflux (n = 37),  hydronephrosis (n = 36), dysplastic kidneys (n = 19), increased kidney size  (n = 19), polycystic kidneys (15 cases), and kidney stones (n = 4). Out of 315  subjects with a 22q13 deletion, 101 (32%) had at least one kidney disorder,  while only one out of 42 (2%) individuals with a SHANK3 pathogenic variant had a  kidney disorder (increased kidney size). We identified two genomic regions that  were significantly associated with having a kidney disorder with the peak  associations observed near positions approximately 5 Mb and 400 Kb from the  telomere. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate genes for kidney disorders include FBLN1, WNT7B,  UPK3A, CELSR1, and PLXNB2. This study demonstrates the utility of patient  registries for uncovering genetic contributions to rare diseases. Future work  should focus on functional studies for these genes to assess their potential  pathogenic contribution to the different subsets of kidney disorders.  © 2023.

Author information: (1)Animal Husbandry Research Institute, Mianyang Academy of Agricultural  Sciences, Mianyang, P. R. China.

In this study, we evaluated the copy number variation in the genomes of two  groups of Beichuan-white goat populations with large differences in litter size  by FST method, and identified 1739 genes and 485 missense mutations in the genes  subject to positive selection. Through functional enrichment, ITGAV, LRP4,  CDH23, TPRN, RYR2 and CELSR1 genes, involved in embryonic morphogenesis, were  essential for litter size trait, which received intensive attention. In  addition, some mutation sites of these genes have been proposed (ITGAV:  c.38C > T; TPRN: c.133A > T, c.1192A > G, c.1250A > C; CELSR1: c.7640T > C),  whose allele frequencies were significantly changed in the high fecundity goat  group. Besides, we found that new mutations at these sites altered the  hydrophilicity and 3D structure of the protein. Candidate genes related to  litter size in this study and their missense mutation sites were identified.  These candidate genes are helpful to understand the genetic mechanism of  fecundity in Beichuan white goat, and have important significance for future  goat breeding.

The Tigray region, where we found around eight per cent of the indigenous cattle  population of Ethiopia, is considered as the historic centre of the country,  with the ancient pre-Aksumite and Aksumite civilisations in contact with the  civilisations of the Fertile Crescent and the Indian subcontinent. Here, we used  whole genome sequencing data to characterise the genomic diversity, relatedness,  and admixture of five cattle populations (Abergelle, Arado, Begait, Erob, and  Raya) indigenous to the Tigray region of Ethiopia. We detected 28 to 29 million  SNPs and 2.7 to 2.9 million indels in each population, of which 7% of SNPs and  34% of indels were novel. Functional annotation of the variants showed around  0.01% SNPs and 0.22%-0.27% indels in coding regions. Enrichment analysis of  genes overlapping missense private SNPs revealed 20 significant GO terms and  KEGG pathways that were shared by or specific to breeds. They included important  genes associated with morphology (SCN4A, TAS1R2 and KCNG4), milk yield (GABRG1),  meat quality (MMRN2, VWC2), feed efficiency (PCDH8 and SLC26A3), immune response  (LAMC1, PCDH18, CELSR1, TLR6 and ITGA5), heat resistance (NPFFR1 and HTR7) and  genes belonging to the olfactory gene family, which may be related to adaptation  to harsh environments. Tigray indigenous cattle are very diverse. Their  genome-wide average nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.0035 to 0.0036. The  number of heterozygous SNPs was about 0.6-0.7 times higher than homozygous ones.  The within-breed average number of ROHs ranged from 777.82 to 1000.45, with the  average sum of the length of ROHs ranging from 122.01 Mbp to 163.88 Mbp. The  genomic inbreeding coefficients differed among animals and breeds, reaching up  to 10% in some Begait and Raya animals. Tigray indigenous cattle shared a common  ancestry with Asian indicine (85.6%-88.7%) and African taurine (11.3%-14.1%)  cattle, with very small, if any, European taurine introgression. This study  identified high within-breed genetic diversity representing an opportunity for  breeding improvement programs and, also, significant novel variants that could  increase the number of known cattle variants, an important contribution to the  knowledge of domestic cattle genetic diversity.

Mesenchymal Vangl facilitates airway elongation and widening independently of  the planar cell polarity complex.  Paramore SV(1), Goodwin K(2), Devenport D(1), Nelson CM(1)(3).

Update in     Development. 2024 Aug 15;151(16):dev202692. doi: 10.1242/dev.202692.  A hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In  the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of  the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it  minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely  requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the  embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the  adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be  regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively  characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation,  elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung.  Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching  morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the  developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role  for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically,  mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation,  and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth  muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal  rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our  data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core  PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in  vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the  embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the  mature lung.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a condition caused by mutations in NOTCH3 and  results in a phenotype characterised by recurrent strokes, vascular dementia and  migraines. Whilst a genetic basis for the disease is known, the molecular  mechanisms underpinning the pathology of CADASIL are still yet to be determined.  Studies conducted at the Genomics Research Centre (GRC) have also identified  that only 15-23% of individuals clinically suspected of CADASIL have mutations  in NOTCH3. Based on this, whole exome sequencing was used to identify novel  genetic variants for CADASIL-like cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD). Analysis  of functionally important variants in 50 individuals was investigated using  overrepresentation tests in Gene ontology software to identify biological  processes that are potentially affected in this group of patients. Further  investigation of the genes in these processes was completed using the TRAPD  software to identify if there is an increased number (burden) of mutations that  are associated with CADASIL-like pathology. Results from this study identified  that cell-cell adhesion genes were positively overrepresented in the PANTHER  GO-slim database. TRAPD burden testing identified n = 15 genes that had a higher  number of rare (MAF < 0.001) and predicted functionally relevant (SIFT < 0.05,  PolyPhen > 0.8) mutations compared to the gnomAD v2.1.1 exome control dataset.  Furthermore, these results identified ARVCF, GPR17, PTPRS, and CELSR1 as novel  candidate genes in CADASIL-related pathology. This study identified a novel  process that may be playing a role in the vascular damage related to  CADASIL-related CSVD and implicated n = 15 genes in playing a role in the  disease.  © 2023.

Defects in mesodermal migration  and blood supply to the caudal region have been identified as possible causes of  caudal developmental defects, but neither satisfactorily explains the structural  malformations in all three germ layers. Here, we describe caudal developmental  defects in transmembrane protein 132a (Tmem132a) mutant mice, including  skeletal, posterior neural tube closure, genitourinary tract and hindgut  defects. We show that, in Tmem132a mutant embryos, visceral endoderm fails to be  excluded from the medial region of early hindgut, leading directly to the loss  or malformation of cloaca-derived genitourinary and gastrointestinal structures,  and indirectly to the neural tube and kidney/ureter defects. We find that  TMEM132A mediates intercellular interaction, and physically interacts with  planar cell polarity (PCP) regulators CELSR1 and FZD6. Genetically, Tmem132a  regulates neural tube closure synergistically with another PCP regulator Vangl2.  In summary, we have identified Tmem132a as a new regulator of PCP, and hindgut  malformation as the underlying cause of developmental defects in multiple caudal  structures.  © 2023.

(#)Contributed equally  The Telomere Repeat-Binding factor 2 (TRF2) contributes to cancer progression by  both telomere-dependent and independent mechanisms, including immune escape and  angiogenesis. Here, we found that TRF2, through its Basic domain, directly  interacts with Emerin forming a complex, including Lamin A/C, Lamin B1, SUN1,  and SUN2. Importantly, TRF2 association with the inner nuclear membrane is  functional to the proper establishment of cell polarity, finally promoting  productive 1D and 3D migration in triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC). In  line with this, a spontaneous model of TNBC metastasis, combined with intravital  imaging, allowed us to demonstrate that TRF2 promotes cell migration at the  primary tumor site and is required for the early steps of the metastatic  cascade. In human breast cancers, aberrantly elevated TRF2 expression positively  correlates with cancer progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis, identifying  TRF2 as a potential target for novel therapeutic strategies against TNBC.  © 2025.

OBJECTIVE: Cholelithiasis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) contribute  to significant health concerns. We aimed to investigate the potential  observational, causal, and genetic relationships between cholelithiasis and  GERD. DESIGN: The observational correlations were assessed based on the prospective  cohort study from UK Biobank. Then, by leveraging the genome-wide summary  statistics of cholelithiasis (N = 334,277) and GERD (N = 332,601), the  bidirectional causal associations were evaluated using Mendelian randomization  (MR) analysis. Subsequently, a series of genetic analyses was used to assess the  genetic correlation, shared loci, and genes between cholelithiasis and GERD. RESULTS: The prospective cohort analyses revealed a significantly increased risk  of GERD in individuals with cholelithiasis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.99; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 1.89-2.10) and a higher risk of cholelithiasis among  patients with GERD (HR = 2.30; 95% CI, 2.18-2.44). The MR study indicated the  causal effect of genetic liability to cholelithiasis on the incidence of GERD  (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.11) and the causal effect of genetic  predicted GERD on cholelithiasis (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.31). In addition,  cholelithiasis and GERD exhibited a strong genetic association. Cross-trait  meta-analyses identified 5 novel independent loci shared between cholelithiasis  and GERD. Three shared genes, including SUN2, CBY1, and JOSD1, were further  identified as novel risk genes. CONCLUSION: The elucidation of the shared genetic basis underlying the  phenotypic relationship of these 2 complex phenotypes offers new insights into  the intrinsic linkage between cholelithiasis and GERD, providing a novel  research direction for future therapeutic strategy and risk prediction.  © The Author(s) 2025.

(#)Contributed equally  Critical to the mechano-regulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), Linker of  the Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex transduces cytoskeletal  forces to the nuclei. The LINC complex contains outer nuclear membrane Nesprin  proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton and their inner nuclear membrane  couplers, SUN proteins. Here we tested the hypothesis that severing of the LINC  complex-mediated cytoskeletal connections may have different effects on  chromatin organization and MSC differentiation than those due to ablation of SUN  proteins. In cells cultured under adipogenic conditions, interrupting LINC  complex function through dominant-negative KASH domain expression (dnKASH)  increased adipogesis while heterochromatin H3K27 and H3K9 methylation was  unaltered. In contrast, SUN1/2 depletion inhibited adipogenic gene expression  and fat droplet formation; as well the anti-adipogenic effect of SUN1/2  depletion was accompanied by increased H3K9me3, which was enriched on Adipoq,  silencing this fat locus. We conclude that releasing the nucleus from  cytoskeletal constraints via dnKASH accelerates adipogenesis while depletion of  SUN1/2 increases heterochromatin accrual on adipogenic genes in a fashion  independent of LINC complex function. Therefore, while these two approaches both  disable LINC complex functions, their divergent effects on the epigenetic  landscape indicate they cannot be used interchangeably to study mechanical  regulation of cell differentiation.  © 2025.

Cellular mechanotransduction is a complex physiological process that integrates  alterations in the external environment with cellular behaviours. In recent  years, the role of the nucleus in mechanotransduction has gathered increased  attention. Our research investigated the involvement of lamin A/C, a component  of the nuclear envelope, in the mechanotransduction of macrophages under  compressive force. We discovered that hydrostatic compressive force induces  heterochromatin formation, decreases SUN1/SUN2 levels, and transiently  downregulates lamin A/C. Notably, downregulated lamin A/C increased nuclear  permeability to yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), thereby amplifying certain  effects of force, such as inflammation induction and proliferation inhibition.  Additionally, lamin A/C deficiency detached the linker of nucleoskeleton and  cytoskeleton (LINC) complex from nuclear envelope, consequently reducing  force-induced DNA damage and IRF4 expression. In summary, lamin A/C exerted dual  effects on macrophage responses to mechanical compression, promoting certain  outcomes while inhibiting others. It operated through two distinct mechanisms:  enhancing nuclear permeability and impairing intracellular mechanotransmission.  The results of this study support the understanding of the mechanisms of  intracellular mechanotransduction and may assist in identifying potential  therapeutic targets for mechanotransduction-related diseases.  © 2024 The Author(s).

Electronic address: feliperodolfo.15@hotmail.com.  Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex disease influenced by many factors, with the  genetic contribution for this neoplasia having a great role in its risk. The  literature brings an increased number of Genome-Wide Association Studies  (GWAS's) that attempt to elucidate the genetic associations with PCa. However,  these genome studies have a considerable rate of false-positive data whose  results may be biased. Therefore, we aimed to apply Bayesian approaches on  significant associations among polymorphisms and PCa from GWAS's data. A  literature search was performed for data published before April 20, 2024,  whereby two investigators used a specific combination of keywords and Boolean  operators in the search (""prostate carcinoma or prostate cancer or PCa"" and  ""polymorphism or genetic variation"" and ""Genome-Wide Association Study or  GWAS""). The records were retrieved, and the data were extracted with further  application of two different Bayesian approaches: The False Positive Report  Probability (FPRP) and the Bayesian False-Discovery Probability (BFDP), both at  the prior probabilities of 10-3 and 10-6. The data were considered as noteworthy  at the level of FPRP <0.2 and BFDP <0.8. Besides, in-silico analyses by  gene-gene network and gene enrichment were performed to evaluate the role of the  noteworthy genes in PCa. As results, 13 GWAS's were included, with 2,520 values  for FPRP and 1,368 values for BFDP being obtained. Our study showed an extensive  number of gene variations as noteworthy candidate biomarkers for PCa risk, with  highlighting for those occurred in the 8q24 locus and in the MSMB, ITGA6, SUN2,  FGF10, INCENP, MLPH, and KLK3 genes.

BACKGROUND: SUN2 is a nuclear envelope protein associated with the nuclear  lamina and with proteins linked to nuclear export, splicing, and  nucleo-cytoskeleton communication. Studies of SUN2 in cancer have been limited  but have suggested that it has tumor-suppressive activity in some carcinomas.  Medulloblastoma is a pediatric tumor that develops in the cerebellum and is  currently classified into four molecular groups: WNT (Wingless), SHH (Sonic  Hedgehog), 3, and 4. SUN2 expression profiles appear to be altered in brain  cancer but have not been previously evaluated in medulloblastoma. METHODS AND RESULTS: The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer (UALCAN)  data analysis portal, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA),  the Oncopression gene expression compendium, and the R2 genomics analysis and  visualization platform were used to analyze SUN2 expression in cancer, which was  found to vary by cancer type; in particular, SUN2 expression was found to be  upregulated in medulloblastoma. We also explored the effects of reduced SUN2  protein levels (by RNA interference) on gene expression profiles using a cDNA  microarray in DAOY medulloblastoma-derived cells. We found that SUN2 protein is  upregulated in medulloblastoma, mainly in the SHH group, which correlates with  poor survival. Furthermore, the reduced SUN2 expression in medulloblastoma cells  is associated with the downregulation of the expression of other genes,  including members of the bitter taste-sensing type 2 receptor (TAS2R) family. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that SUN2 is upregulated in medulloblastoma-with  molecular interplay in gene expression-which has group-dependent implications  for medulloblastoma development. In particular, the upregulation of SUN2 is  associated with a progression of the SHH group of medulloblastoma.  © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

Gender-affirming surgery (GAS) is a highly personalized decision for transgender  and gender diverse (TGD) individuals. However, the proportion of TGD individuals  who desire GAS is unknown. A questionnaire was created after identifying themes  surrounding experiences with gender-affirming medical care by community focus  groups. Respondents who reported medically transitioning and who had undergone  GAS were compared to those without prior GAS. From 88 completed surveys, 18  (20.5%) individuals did not wish to undergo GAS. Of those medically  transitioning and desiring GAS, 15.2% (9/59) desired GAS but had not received it  yet, with 6.7% (6/9) identifying as non-binary. Individuals who had not had GAS  were more likely to earn under $15,000 annually, compared to $25,000-49,000 in  the GAS group (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in educational  level (p = 0.32) or insurance status (p = 0.33). Of TGD individuals who desire  GAS, out-of-pocket expenses such as hair removal, opaque insurance policies,  lack of social support, and access to gender-affirming providers can hinder the  transition process. Understanding barriers and rationales for pursuing GAS can  provide targets for improving healthcare delivery to this diverse population.  © 2024.

The nucleoskeleton is essential for nuclear architecture as well as genome  integrity and gene expression. In addition to lamins, titin or spectrins,  dynamic actin filament polymerization has emerged as a potential intranuclear  structural element but its functions are less well explored. Here we found that  calcium elevations trigger rapid nuclear actin assembly requiring the nuclear  membrane protein SUN2 independently of its function as a component of the LINC  complex. Instead, SUN2 colocalized and associated with the formin and actin  nucleator INF2 in the nuclear envelope in a calcium-regulated manner. Moreover,  SUN2 is required for active RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) clustering in  response to calcium elevations. Thus, our data uncover a SUN2-formin module  linking the nuclear envelope to intranuclear actin assembly to promote  signal-dependent spatial reorganization of active RNA Pol II.  © 2024.

Recent studies highlight the critical involvement of long non-coding RNAs  (lncRNAs) in modulating viral replication and immune responses, yet their  specific roles in flavivirus infections remain underexplored. Our study has  identified lncRNA SUN2-AS1, which is significantly upregulated in response to  flavivirus infection in A549, Huh7 cells, and monocyte-differentiated  macrophages (MDMs). SUN2-AS1 interacts with the transcription factors NF-κB and  STAT1, andits expression is induced by ZIKV RNA via the type I interferon (IFN)  pathway. Notably, SUN2-AS1 enhances the infection of flaviviruses, including  ZIKV, DENV2, and JEV, while showing no effect on VSV or HSV-1 infections.  Mechanistically, SUN2-AS1 exerts a proviral effect by inhibiting the  transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These findings uncover a  novel mechanism by which lncRNAs facilitate flavivirus propagation and highlight  SUN2-AS1 as a potential target for antiviral therapeutic strategies.

(#)Contributed equally  Meiotic rapid prophase chromosome movements (RPMs) require connections between  the chromosomes and the cytoskeleton, involving SUN  (Sad1/UNC-84)-domain-containing proteins at the inner nuclear envelope (NE).  RPMs remain significantly understudied in plants, with respect to their  importance in the regulation of meiosis. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis  thaliana meiotic centromeres undergo rapid (up to 500 nm/s) and uncoordinated  movements during the zygotene and pachytene stages. These centromere movements  are not affected by altered chromosome organization and recombination but are  abolished in the double mutant sun1 sun2. We also document the changes in  chromosome dynamics and nucleus organization during the transition from  leptotene to zygotene, including telomere attachment to SUN-enriched NE domains,  bouquet formation, and nucleolus displacement, all of which were defective in  sun1 sun2. These results establish A. thaliana as a model species for studying  the functional implications of meiotic RPMs and demonstrate the mechanistic  conservation of telomere-led RPMs in plants.  © 2024.

Inhibition of PDIs Downregulates Core LINC Complex Proteins, Promoting the  Invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells in Confined Spaces In Vitro.

Eukaryotic cells tether the nucleoskeleton to the cytoskeleton via a conserved  molecular bridge, called the LINC complex. The core of the LINC complex  comprises SUN-domain and KASH-domain proteins that directly associate within the  nuclear envelope lumen. Intra- and inter-chain disulphide bonds, along with  KASH-domain protein interactions, both contribute to the tertiary and quaternary  structure of vertebrate SUN-domain proteins. The significance of these bonds and  the role of PDIs (protein disulphide isomerases) in LINC complex biology remains  unclear. Reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE analyses revealed a prevalence of  SUN2 homodimers in non-tumorigenic breast epithelia MCF10A cells, but not in the  invasive triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line. Furthermore,  super-resolution microscopy revealed SUN2 staining alterations in MCF10A, but  not in MDA-MB-231 nuclei, upon reducing agent exposure. While PDIA1 levels were  similar in both cell lines, pharmacological inhibition of PDI activity in  MDA-MB-231 cells led to SUN-domain protein down-regulation, as well as Nesprin-2  displacement from the nucleus. This inhibition also caused changes in  perinuclear cytoskeletal architecture and lamin downregulation, and increased  the invasiveness of PDI-inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells in space-restrictive in vitro  environments, compared to untreated cells. These results emphasise the key roles  of PDIs in regulating LINC complex biology, cellular architecture, biomechanics,  and invasion.

(2)McAllister Heart Institute, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,  NC, United States.  Vascular endothelial cells line the inner surface of all blood vessels, where  they are exposed to polarized mechanical forces throughout their lifespan. Both  basal substrate interactions and apical blood flow-induced shear stress regulate  blood vessel development, remodeling, and maintenance of vascular homeostasis.  Disruption of these interactions leads to dysfunction and vascular pathologies,  although how forces are sensed and integrated to affect endothelial cell  behaviors is incompletely understood. Recently the endothelial cell nucleus has  emerged as a prominent force-transducing organelle that participates in vascular  mechanotransduction, via communication to and from cell-cell and cell-matrix  junctions. The LINC complex, composed of SUN and nesprin proteins, spans the  nuclear membranes and connects the nuclear lamina, the nuclear envelope, and the  cytoskeleton. Here we review LINC complex involvement in endothelial cell  mechanotransduction, describe unique and overlapping functions of each LINC  complex component, and consider emerging evidence that two major SUN proteins,  SUN1 and SUN2, orchestrate a complex interplay that extends outward to cell-cell  and cell-matrix junctions and inward to interactions within the nucleus and  chromatin. We discuss these findings in relation to vascular pathologies such as  Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a premature aging disorder with  cardiovascular impairment. More knowledge of LINC complex regulation and  function will help to understand how the nucleus participates in endothelial  cell force sensing and how dysfunction leads to cardiovascular disease.

Whether tumors  and CNS share similar programs of immunosuppression is elusive. Here, we analyze  multi-omics data of tumors from HER2+ breast cancer patients receiving  trastuzumab and anti-PD-L1 antibody and find that CNS-enriched  N-acetyltransferase 8-like (NAT8L) and its metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA)  are overexpressed in resistant tumors. In CNS, NAA is released during brain  inflammation. NAT8L attenuates brain inflammation and impairs anti-tumor  immunity by inhibiting cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+  T cells via NAA. NAA disrupts the formation of immunological synapse by  promoting PCAF-induced acetylation of lamin A-K542, which inhibits the  integration between lamin A and SUN2 and impairs polarization of lytic granules.  We uncover that tumor cells mimic the anti-inflammatory mechanism of CNS to  evade anti-tumor immunity and NAT8L is a potential target to enhance efficacy of  anti-cancer agents.

(4)Urology Institute, University Hospitals Cleveland Health System, Cleveland,  OH.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate plaintiff and defendant characteristics associated with  iatrogenic genitourinary (GU) trauma litigation and outcomes of closed claims. METHODS: LexisNexis was queried in April 2023 using terms related to GU organs  and injury, and manually reviewed for iatrogenic cases. Case details including  defendant, organ involvement, and legal outcome were obtained. Multinomial  regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with outcome. RESULTS: Four hundred ten cases involving 611 defendants were identified, with  the ureter the most commonly affected organ (202/410, 49.3%). Most cases  involved adult plaintiffs (380, 92.7%) and resulted in favor of the defense  (227, 55.4%). Injuries resulted most frequently from gynecologic surgeries (179,  43.7%). Defendants were most commonly obstetricians/gynecologists (243/611,  39.8%) and urologists (168, 27.5%). Penile (OR 6.3 [95% CI 2.5-16.1]) and  urethral (OR 4.8 [2.0-11.7]) injuries were associated with greater odds of a  plaintiff verdict relative to ureter injury. A plaintiff verdict was also more  likely when defendants were academic hospitals compared to individual  practitioners (OR 4.3 [1.9-9.9]). In cases ruling in favor of the plaintiff,  indemnity payments were larger when the defendants were comprised of individual  practitioners compared to a hospital or medical group (median $549,613 vs  $250,000, P <.001). CONCLUSION: Urologists may be involved in medical malpractice lawsuits for  iatrogenic injury even when they are uninvolved in the index procedure. Most  cases that reach litigation result in defense verdicts regardless of the GU  organ injured. Defendant characteristics associated with plaintiff verdicts are  more nuanced, and providers should be aware of potential downstream effects of  litigation.  Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine urethral outcomes of single-stage metoidioplasty and  radial forearm free flap (RFFF) phalloplasty using the labia minora ring flap  for urethral lengthening (UL). METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing  single-stage metoidioplasty and RFFF phalloplasty utilizing the labia minora  ring flap technique. The ring flap consists of endodermal labia minora tissue  ventral to the clitoris and surrounding the vaginal introitus. During  metoidioplasty, the ring flap accounts for the entirety of UL. During RFFF  phalloplasty, the ring flap becomes the pars fixa (PF) urethra. The primary  outcomes measured were rates of fistula, stricture, and surgical revision. RESULTS: Between November 2017 and August 2023, 311 patients underwent  metoidioplasty or RFFF phalloplasty (mean follow-up 37 months). Of the 69  metoidioplasties, urethrocutaneous fistulas developed in 11 patients (16%);  strictures occurred in 4 (6%). Of the 242 phalloplasty patients, there were 71  fistulas (29%), 56 of which resolved spontaneously. Strictures developed in 44  patients (18%). Twenty-five patients (10%) developed both a stricture and  fistula. Surgical repair was required in 8/69 (12%) metoidioplasty patients and  in 46/242 (19%) RFFF phalloplasty patients for an overall revision rate of 17%. CONCLUSION: UL during metoidioplasty or RFFF phalloplasty can be accomplished in  a single stage using the labia minora ring flap with comparable surgical  revision rates to previously described techniques. This approach can also be  applied to other phalloplasty techniques. Many fistulas of the PF urethra  resolve spontaneously. Higher urethral revision rates were seen in phalloplasty  compared to metoidioplasty.  Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Electronic address: h.r.fuller@keele.ac.uk.  LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD) is caused by mutations in the  LMNA gene, encoding lamin A/C. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of  L-CMD, proteomic profiling using DIA mass spectrometry was conducted on  immortalized myoblasts and myotubes from controls and L-CMD donors each  harbouring a different LMNA mutation (R249W, del.32 K and L380S). Compared to  controls, 124 and 228 differentially abundant proteins were detected in L-CMD  myoblasts and myotubes, respectively, and were associated with enriched  canonical pathways including synaptogenesis and necroptosis in myoblasts, and  Huntington's disease and insulin secretion in myotubes. Abnormal nuclear  morphology and reduced lamin A/C and emerin abundance was evident in all L-CMD  cell lines compared to controls, while nucleoplasmic aggregation of lamin A/C  was restricted to del.32 K cells, and mislocalization of emerin was restricted  to R249W cells. Abnormal nuclear morphology indicates loss of nuclear lamina  integrity as a common feature of L-CMD, likely rendering muscle cells vulnerable  to mechanically induced stress, while differences between L-CMD cell lines in  emerin and lamin A localization suggests that some molecular alterations in  L-CMD are mutation specific. Nonetheless, identifying common proteomic  alterations and molecular pathways across all three L-CMD lines has highlighted  potential targets for the development of non-mutation specific therapies.

(#)Contributed equally  The Berlin Fat Mouse Inbred line (BFMI) is a model for obesity and metabolic  syndrome. The sublines BFMI861-S1 and BFMI861-S2 differ in weight despite high  genetic similarity and a shared obesity-related locus. This study focused on  identifying additional body weight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by analyzing  weekly weight measurements in a male population of the advanced intercross line  BFMI861-S1 x BFMI861-S2. QTL analysis, utilizing 200 selectively genotyped mice  (GigaMUGA) and 197 males genotyped for top SNPs, revealed a genome-wide  significant QTL on Chr 15 (68.46 to 81.40 Mb) for body weight between weeks 9 to  20. Notably, this QTL disappeared (weeks 21 to 23) and reappeared (weeks 24 and  25) coinciding with a diet change. Additionally, a significant body weight QTL  on Chr 16 (3.89 to 22.79 Mb) was identified from weeks 6 to 25. Candidate genes,  including Gpt, Cbx6, Apol6, Apol8, Sun2 (Chr 15) and Trap1, Rrn3, Mapk1 (Chr  16), were prioritized. This study unveiled two additional body weight QTLs, one  of which is novel and responsive to diet changes. These findings illuminate  genomic regions influencing weight in BFMI and emphasize the utility of time  series data in uncovering novel genetic factors.  © 2024. The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally  Cytoskeleton is extensively recruited by flaviviruses for their infection. In  this study, we uncovered an essential role of a nuclear membrane protein,  SAD1/UNC84 domain protein 2 (SUN2) linking cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton in  the flavivirus replication. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SUN2, but not SUN1,  significantly reduces the replication of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV),  and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). In contrast, SUN2 does not affect the  infection of non-flaviviridae RNA viruses. All three regions of SUN2 are  required for its proviral effect. Mechanistically, SUN2 facilitates  rearrangement of cytoskeleton and formation of replication organelles induced by  viral infection, and hence promotes viral RNA synthesis. SUN2 is required for  the interaction between cytoskeleton actin and ZIKV nonstructural protein 1  (NS1). Expression of dominant negative Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2, which connect  SUN2 to cytoskeleton proteins, alleviates the interaction between actin and NS1  and reduces viral replication levels. In a neonatal mouse infection model, SUN2  knockout dramatically alleviates the in vivo ZIKV replication and development of  neuropathology. This work elucidates that recruitment of cytoskeleton proteins  by flavivirus is coordinated by nuclear membrane proteins SUN2 and Nesprins,  providing evidence for a link between nuclear membrane proteins and flavivirus  infection.  © 2024.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) arises from the renal  parenchymal epithelium and is the predominant malignant entity of renal cancer,  exhibiting increasing incidence and mortality rates over time. SEC14-like 3  (SEC14L3) has emerged as a compelling target for cancer intervention;  nevertheless, the precise clinical implications and molecular underpinnings of  SEC14L3 in ccRCC remain elusive. METHODS: By leveraging clinical data and data from the TCGA-ccRCC and GEO  datasets, we investigated the association between SEC14L3 expression levels and  overall survival rates in ccRCC patients. The biological role and mechanism of  SEC14L3 in ccRCC were investigated via in vivo and in vitro experiments.  Moreover, siRNA-SEC14L3@PDA@MUC12 nanoparticles (SSPM-NPs) were synthesized and  assessed for their therapeutic potential against SEC14L3 through in vivo and in  vitro assays. RESULTS: Our investigation revealed upregulated SEC14L3 expression in ccRCC  tissues, and exogenous downregulation of SEC14L3 robustly suppressed the  malignant traits of ccRCC cells. Mechanistically, knocking down SEC14L3  facilitated the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of ribosomal protein S3  (RPS3) and augmented IκBα accumulation in ccRCC. This concerted action thwarted  the nuclear translocation of P65, thereby abrogating the activation of the  nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signaling pathway and impeding ccRCC cell  proliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, diminished SEC14L3 levels exerted a  suppressive effect on NFKB1 expression within the NFκB signaling cascade. NFKB1  functions as a transcriptional regulator capable of binding to the SEC14L3  enhancer and promoter, thereby promoting SEC14L3 expression. Consequently, the  inhibition of SEC14L3 expression was further potentiated, thus forming a  positive feedback loop. Additionally, we observed that downregulation of SEC14L3  significantly increased the sensitivity of ccRCC cells to sunitinib. The  evaluation of SSPM-NPs nanotherapy highlighted its effectiveness in combination  with sunitinib for inhibiting ccRCC growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings not only underscore the promise of SEC14L3 as a  therapeutic target but also unveil an SEC14L3/RPS3/NFκB positive feedback loop  that curtails ccRCC progression. Modulating SEC14L3 expression to engage this  positive feedback loop might herald novel avenues for ccRCC treatment.  © 2024. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has gradually become an important therapy option for  lung cancer patients. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)  databases were responsible for all the public data. RESULTS: In our study, we firstly identified 22 characteristic genes of NSCLC  immunotherapy response using the machine learning algorithm. Molecule subtyping  was then conducted and two patient subtypes were identified Cluster1 and  Cluster2. Results showed that Cluster1 patients had a lower TIDE score and were  more sensitive to immunotherapy in both TCGA and combined GEO cohorts.  Biological enrichment analysis showed that pathways of epithelial-mesenchymal  transition (EMT), apical junction, KRAS signaling, myogenesis, G2M checkpoint,  E2F targets, WNT/β-catenin signaling, hedgehog signaling, hypoxia were activated  in Cluster2 patients. Genomic instability between Cluster1 and Cluster2 patients  was not significantly different. Interestingly, we found that female patients  were more adaptable to immunotherapy. Biological enrichment revealed that  compared with female patients, pathways of MYC target, G2M checkpoints, mTORC1  signaling, MYC target, E2F target, KRAS signaling, oxidative phosphorylation,  mitotic spindle and P53 pathway were activated. Meanwhile, monocytes might have  a potential role in affecting NSCLC immunotherapy and underlying mechanism has  been explored. Finally, we found that SEC14L3 and APCDD1L were the underlying  targets affecting immunotherapy, as well as patients survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results can provide direction and guidance for future  research focused on NSCLC immunotherapy.  Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Wu, Huang, Du, Nie, Su and Li.

Electronic address:  heying@hnca.org.cn.  Breast cancer, the most prevalent malignancy in women, is also the leading cause  of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. The activation of the Wnt pathway  plays a pivotal role in the metastatic abilities of breast cancer. In this  study, IL1F6, MRGPRX1, and SEC14L3 were significantly correlated to breast  cancer patients'overall survival based on TCGA-BRCA dataset. Although IL1F6,  MRGPRX1 and SEC14L3 high expression were associated with better survival in  breast cancer patients, SEC14L3 had the biggest survival benefit for breast  cancer; therefore, SEC14L3 was selected for the subsequent investigation.  SEC14L3 mRNA expression and protein levels within breast cancer cell lines  decreased compared with normal human breast epithelial cells. Overexpressing  SEC14L3 in breast cancer cells inhibited the malignant phenotypes of cancer  cells, including the capacity of cells to migrate and invade. SEC14L3  overexpression decreased the levels of mesenchymal markers, whereas SEC14L3  knockdown facilitated the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells. SEC14L3  overexpression also inhibited Wnt/β-catenin activation. The Wnt agonist  strengthened the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells; moreover, the  anti-tumor effects of SEC14L3 overexpression were partially attenuated by the  Wnt agonist. Conclusively, SEC14L3, which is underexpressed in breast cancer  cells and tissues, could play a tumor-suppressive role in a  Wnt/β-catenin-related way.  Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

(#)Contributed equally  Endosome fission is essential for cargo sorting and targeting in the endosomal  system. However, whether organelles other than the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  participate in endosome fission through membrane contacts is unknown. Here, we  characterize a Golgi-derived vesicle, the SEC14L2 compartment, that plays a  unique role in facilitating endosome fission through ternary contacts with  endosomes and the ER. Localized to the ER-mediated endosome fission site, the  phosphatidylinositol transfer protein SEC14L2 promotes phosphatidylinositol  4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) conversion  before endosome fission. In the absence of SEC14L2, endosome fission is  attenuated and more enlarged endosomes arise due to endosomal accumulation of  PtdIns4P and reduction in PtdIns3P. Collectively, our data suggest roles of the  Golgi network in ER-associated endosome fission and a mechanism involving  ER-endosome contacts in the regulation of endosomal phosphoinositide conversion.  © 2021.

Electronic address: fmuxe@163.com.  BACKGROUND: Optimal non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain to be identified. AIMS: To identify potential DNA methylation biomarkers for NAFLD. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed to identify  differentially methylated CpG sites in peripheral blood leukocytes.  Differentially methylated regions were validated using the MassCLEAVE assay. The  expression levels of candidate genes were explored by Gene Expression Omnibus  database. RESULTS: The hypomethylation of PRKCE CpG 4.5 and CpG 18.19 was associated with  nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval  (CI) were 0.129 (0.026-0.639) and 0.231 (0.069-0.768). The methylation level of  CpG 1.2 and average methylation level of SEC14L3 were correlated with NAFL, with  OR (95% CI) being 0.283 (0.093-0.865) and 0.264 (0.087-0.799). PRKCE CpG 4.5 and  cg17802464 of SEC14L3 were correlated with body mass index, waist circumference,  total triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine  aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. All selected datasets showed  high expression levels of PRKCE and SEC14L3 in patients with NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the hypomethylation of PRKCE and SEC14L3  promoters represent attractive biomarkers for NAFLD. Further studies are  warranted to validate these biomarkers as molecular tools for diagnosis of NAFLD  and therapeutic targets.  Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

INTRODUCTION: Hypertension occurs profoundly in the world, and left ventricular  (LV) remodeling containing functional, structural, and mechanical changes  induced by uncontrolled blood pressure is a well-known complication, however the  underlying mechanism is still obscure. METHODS: To determine differences in gene expression profiles of hypertension  and LV remodeling consequence to hypertension, Gene Expression Omnibus 2R online  tool was used to identify differently expressed genes. Publicly available  databases including GeneMANIA, database for annotation, visualization and  integrated discovery, search tool for the retrieva predicting associated  transcription factors (TF) from annotated affinities interacting genes,  Predicting Associated TF from Annotated Affinities, JASPAR and Comparative  Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) were accessed to perform an integrated  bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one genes (SEC14L3, EML7, PSMD7, PSMA1, GLRX, CNOT10, NBR1,  DUSP12, STRAP, SMIM14, RBM8A, TMEM59, TMEM87A,PSMC1, CASP4, ITGB8, DNAJA1,  PINK1, PRNP, SAP30L, and EIF3M) were found overexpression in both hypertension  and hypertensive LV remodeling. Biological process analysis first revealed that  enrichment of these target genes correlated with regulation of cellular amino  acid metabolic process, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide  antigen via MHC class I, TAP-dependent and proteasome complex, 3 different  expression genes (DEGs) participate significantly enriched in NFκB, WNT, and  MAPK pathways, meanwhile, 47% DEGs displayed similar co-expression  characteristics. Furthermore, the transcription factors associated with key DEGs  were identified. Finally, the TF (HAND1, E4BP4, ESR1, VBP, ELK-1, POU3F2)  associated with LV remodeling in hypertension were confirmed to act a crucial  role in correlated heart diseases. CONCLUSION: The present study reveals the targeted genes probably associated  with LV remodeling in hypertension by bioinformatics-based analyses, which  provides clues for prognosis judgement and pharmacological therapies.

The transition from land to water in whales and dolphins (cetaceans) was  accompanied by remarkable adaptations. To reveal genomic changes that occurred  during this transition, we screened for protein-coding genes that were  inactivated in the ancestral cetacean lineage. We found 85 gene losses. Some of  these were likely beneficial for cetaceans, for example, by reducing the risk of  thrombus formation during diving (F12 and KLKB1), erroneous DNA damage repair  (POLM), and oxidative stress-induced lung inflammation (MAP3K19). Additional  gene losses may reflect other diving-related adaptations, such as enhanced  vasoconstriction during the diving response (mediated by SLC6A18) and altered  pulmonary surfactant composition (SEC14L3), while loss of SLC4A9 relates to a  reduced need for saliva. Last, loss of melatonin synthesis and receptor genes  (AANAT, ASMT, and MTNR1A/B) may have been a precondition for adopting  unihemispheric sleep. Our findings suggest that some genes lost in ancestral  cetaceans were likely involved in adapting to a fully aquatic lifestyle.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates vasculogenesis by using its  tyrosine kinase receptors. However, little is known about whether Sec14-like  phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PTP) are involved in this process. Here,  we show that zebrafish sec14l3, one of the family members, specifically  participates in artery and vein formation via regulating angioblasts and  subsequent venous progenitors' migration during vasculogenesis. Vascular defects  caused by sec14l3 depletion are partially rescued by restoration of VEGFR2  signaling at the receptor or downstream effector level. Biochemical analyses  show that Sec14l3/SEC14L2 physically bind to VEGFR2 and prevent it from  dephosphorylation specifically at the Y1175 site by peri-membrane tyrosine  phosphatase PTP1B, therefore potentiating VEGFR2 signaling activation.  Meanwhile, Sec14l3 and SEC14L2 interact with RAB5A/4A and facilitate the  formation of their GTP-bound states, which might be critical for VEGFR2  endocytic trafficking. Thus, we conclude that Sec14l3 controls vasculogenesis in  zebrafish via the regulation of VEGFR2 activation.

Cytosine methylation is an effective way to modulate gene transcription.However,  very little is knownabout the epigenetic changes in the host that is infected  with Salmonella enterica. In this study, we usedmethylatedDNA  immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyse the genomewide DNA methylation changes  in domestic chickens after infected with Salmonella. The level of DNA  methylation was slightly higher in the genomic regions around the transcription  start termination sites in a Salmonella-infected group compared to the controls.  Overall, 879 peaks were differentially methylated between Salmonella-infected  and control groups, among which 135 were located in the gene promoter regions.  Genes including MHC class IV antigen, GABARAPL1, MR1 and KDM1B were shown to be  methylated more heavily after infected with Salmonella, whereas DYNLRB2, SEC14L3  and ANKIB1 tended to have fewer methylated cytosine residues in the promoter  regions.Gene interaction network analysis of differentiallymethylated genes in  the promoter regions revealed extensive connections with immune-related genes,  indicating the possible impact of infection with Salmonella on the epigenetic  status of the host.

Author information: (1)State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life  Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.  The non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway plays important roles in embryonic  development, tissue formation and diseases. However, it is unclear how the Wnt  ligand-stimulated, G protein-coupled receptor Frizzled activates phospholipases  for calcium release. Here, we report that the zebrafish/human  phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sec14l3/SEC14L2 act as GTPase proteins to  transduce Wnt signals from Frizzled to phospholipase C (PLC). Depletion of  sec14l3 attenuates Wnt/Ca2+ responsive activity and causes convergent and  extension (CE) defects in zebrafish embryos. Biochemical analyses in mammalian  cells indicate that Sec14l3-GDP forms complex with Frizzled and Dishevelled; Wnt  ligand binding of Frizzled induces translocation of Sec14l3 to the plasma  membrane; and then Sec14l3-GTP binds to and activates phospholipase Cδ4a  (Plcδ4a); subsequently, Plcδ4a initiates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate  (PIP2) signaling, ultimately stimulating calcium release. Furthermore, Plcδ4a  can act as a GTPase-activating protein to accelerate the hydrolysis of  Sec14l3-bound GTP to GDP. Our data provide a new insight into GTPase  protein-coupled Wnt/Ca2+ signaling transduction.

Asthma is highly prevalent, but current therapies cannot influence the chronic  course of the disease. It is thus important to understand underlying early  molecular events. In this study, we aimed to use microRNAs (miRNAs) - which are  critical regulators of signaling cascades - to identify so far uncharacterized  asthma pathogenesis pathways. Therefore, deregulation of miRNAs was assessed in  whole lungs from mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation  (AAI). In silico predicted target genes were confirmed in reporter assays and in  house-dust-mite (HDM) induced AAI and primary human bronchial epithelial cells  (NHBE) cultured at the air-liquid interface. We identified and validated the  transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein (Creb1) and its  transcriptional co-activators (Crtc1-3) as targets of miR-17, miR-144, and  miR-21. Sec14-like 3 (Sec14l3) - a putative target of Creb1 - was down-regulated  in both asthma models and in NHBE cells upon IL13 treatment, while it's  expression correlated with ciliated cell development and decreased along with  increasing goblet cell metaplasia. Finally, we propose that Creb1/Crtc1-3 and  Sec14l3 could be important for early responses of the bronchial epithelium to  Th2-stimuli. This study shows that miRNA profiles can be used to identify novel  targets that would be overlooked in mRNA based strategies.

Pulmonary surfactant, a complex composed primarily of lipids and associated  proteins, is synthesized in alveolar type II (ATII) cells and secreted into  alveoli to prevent collapse during respiration. Although numerous studies have  clarified the fundamental roles of pulmonary surfactant, the molecular  mechanisms of transport and secretion of pulmonary surfactant remain totally  unknown. Thus, we screened candidate genes by comparing genes with the expressed  sequence tag (EST) libraries of embryonic and adult lungs by using the digital  differential display method in the National Center for Biotechnology Information  (NCBI) database. We identified Sec14-like 3 (Sec14L3) as a new class of  lipid-associated proteins highly expressed in ATII cells. We found that Sec14L3  expression is >100-fold increased during the perinatal period in the lung.  Furthermore, Sec14L3 bound to small-sized liposomes (30 nm in diameter), but not  to large-sized liposomes (100 nm diameter), through its Sec14 domain. Because of  the increased curvature, lipid-packing defects are more likely to occur in  small-sized liposomes than in large-sized liposomes. Based on these results, we  conclude that Sec14L3 is a new class of lipid-packing sensor. Sec14L3 may play  important roles in the lung, such as intracellular lipid transport, surfactant  maturation, and endo/exocytosis.  DOI: 10.1096/fj.13-237941 PMID: 24018064 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",[]

Airway epithelium is a key component for airway integrity. Previously, we found  that expression of the Sec14l3 gene that encodes a 45-kDa secretory protein is  inversely associated with the progression of experimentally induced airway  inflammation and degeneration/necrosis of alveolar epithelium. In this report,  using in situ hybridization we demonstrated that the ciliated cells in mouse  lung selectively express Sec14l3 mRNA. In a three-dimensional culture of mouse  tracheal epithelial cells, levels of the Sec14l3 mRNA correlated with the  differentiation of ciliated cells. Intranasal infection of adult mice with  influenza virus resulted in a 20-fold, progressive decrease in Sec14l3 mRNA  expression over 10 days post infection. These results enhance the potential  value of Sec14l3 as a ciliated epithelial cell-specific biomarker for the  progression of airway inflammations such as airway viral infection and asthma.

Author information: (1)Bioscience Department, Tsukuba Research Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline KK,  Tsukuba, Japan. shanlihua2002@hotmail.com  Bronchial asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways. The Sec14l3 gene,  encoding a 45-kDa secretory protein, is specifically expressed in airway  epithelium. Here, we report on the kinetics of Sec14l3 expression following  allergic inflammation of the lung. Brown Norway rats were sensitized by  intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin, followed by challenge with aerosolized  ovalbumin after a 3-week interval. This animal model showed many features  similar to human allergic asthma: an increase in inflammatory cells such as  eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid  and histopathological alteration of lung tissue, exhibiting infiltration of  these inflammatory cells and degeneration and necrosis of alveolar epithelium.  These parameters reached their maximal level 24h after allergen challenge. In  contrast, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated a rapid  and significant reduction of Sec14l3 mRNA in lung tissue and maximum reduction  (to 1.4% of the control) was observed at 24h. Pretreatment with dexamethasone  significantly suppressed both the Sec14I3 mRNA reduction and all of the  inflammatory changes. The 45-kDa secretory protein was identified in the  supernatant of BAL fluids. Two-dimensional gel images of the supernatant  proteome also revealed down-regulation of the protein following inflammation (to  approximately 30% of the control at 24h). Thus, Sec14l3 expression is highly and  inversely associated with the progression of airway inflammation. Sec14l3 mRNA  and protein may function in the homeostasis of airway epithelial cells under  normal conditions.

Author information: (1)State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Genetics, School of  Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, People's Republic of China.  Supernatant protein factor (SPF) and alpha-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP)  both belong to a widespread lipid-binding Sec 14-like protein family. All the  members of the family have the lipid-binding motif called CRAL_TRIO. SPF is  showed to stimulate the conversion of squalene to lanosterol and enhance  cholesterol biosynthesis. TAP is identified to be involved in the intracellular  distribution of alpha-tocopherol. Recently TAP is identified as SPF though they  have very different functions. Here we report a human SPF/TAP homology SEC14L3  with 2082 base pairs in length and contains an open reading frame encoding a 400  amino acids protein. Analysis shows that SEC14L3 is mapped to 22q12 and  expresses only in the liver among the used sixteen tissues in the test.

Rat supernatant protein factor-like protein stimulates squalene monooxygenase  and is activated by protein kinase A.  Mokashi V(1), Singh DK, Porter TD.  Author information: (1)Graduate Center for Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky,  Lexington, KY 40536-0305, USA.  Rat supernatant protein factor-like protein (SPF2) shares 90% sequence identity  with rat SPF and 77% identity with human SPF, both of which have been shown to  stimulate squalene monooxygenase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. SPF2  appears to be predominantly expressed in respiratory and epithelial tissues,  whereas SPF is expressed in liver. To determine if SPF2 was also able to  stimulate squalene monooxygenase activity, we have cloned, expressed, and  purified the protein following heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. SPF2  was only half as effective as SPF in stimulating squalene epoxidation and was  more strongly inhibited by GTP and GDP. The inhibition by guanine nucleotides  was fully prevented by alpha-tocopherol, a reported ligand for these proteins.  Incubation of SPF2 with protein kinase A and ATP increased its activity by about  twofold, has been found for SPF. These results indicate that SPF2 activity is  modulated by guanine nucleotides and alpha-tocopherol, as well as by  phosphorylation.

(#)Contributed equally  BACKGROUND: Small RNAs are essential for germ cell development and  fertilization. However, fundamental questions remain, such as the level of  conservation in small RNA composition between species and whether small RNAs  control transposable elements in mammalian oocytes. RESULTS: Here, we use high-throughput sequencing to profile small RNAs and  poly(A)-bearing long RNAs in oocytes of 12 representative vertebrate species  (including 11 mammals). The results show that miRNAs are generally expressed in  the oocytes of each representative species (although at low levels), whereas  endo-siRNAs are specific to mice. Notably, piRNAs are predominant in oocytes of  all species (except mice) and vary widely in length. We find PIWIL3-associated  piRNAs are widespread in mammals and generally lack 3'-2'-O-methylation.  Additionally, sequence identity is low between homologous piRNAs in different  species, even among those present in syntenic piRNA clusters. Despite the  species-specific divergence, piRNAs retain the capacity to silence younger TE  subfamilies in oocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings illustrate a high level of diversity in  the small RNA populations of mammalian oocytes. Furthermore, we identify  sequence features related to conserved roles of small RNAs in silencing TEs,  providing a large-scale reference for future in-depth study of small RNA  functions in oocytes.  © 2024.

BACKGROUND: P-Element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI) proteins, when in combination  with PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), are engaged in the epigenetic regulation of  gene expression in germline cells. Different types of tumour cells have been  found to exhibit abnormal expression of piRNA, PIWIL-mRNAs, and proteins. We  aimed to determine the mRNA expression profiles of PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3, &  PIWIL4, in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and to associate their expression  patterns with clinicopathological features. METHODS: The expression patterns of PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3, PIWIL4 mRNA, was  assessed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR), on  tissue and serum samples from HCC patients, their impact for diagnosis was  evaluated by ROC curves, prognostic utility was determined, and In Silico  analysis was conducted for predicted variant detection, association with HCC  microRNAs and Network Analysis. RESULTS: Expression levels were significantly higher in both HCC tissue and  serum samples than in their respective controls (p< 0.001). Additionally, the  diagnostic performance was assessed, Risk determination was found to be  statistically significant. CONCLUSION: PIWIL mRNAs are overexpressed in HCC tissue and serum samples, the  expression patterns could be valuable molecular markers for HCC, due to their  association with age, tumour grade and pattern. To the best of our knowledge,  our study is the first to report the expression levels of all PIWIL mRNA and to  suggest their remarkable values as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, in  addition to their correlation to HCC development. Additionally, a therapeutic  opportunity might be also suggested through in silico miRNA prediction for HCC  and PIWIL genes through DDX4 and miR-124-3p.

BACKGROUND: Recently, aberrant expression of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) has  been discovered in a variety of cancer cells. However, the roles of PIWI  proteins and piRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) are still elusive. METHODS: RT-qPCR and Northern blotting were used to evaluate piR-13643 levels in  PTC and para-carcinoma tissues, as well as in PTC cell lines. piR-13643 mimic  and piR-13643 inhibitor were transfected into K-1 and B-CPAP cells. CCK-8,  Transwell, annexin V-FITC/PI, flow cytometry and Western blot assays were  performed to measure cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, cell cycle and  E-cadherin and Vimentin proteins, respectively. Total RNA from B-CPAP cells was  pulled down with PIWIL1, PIWIL2, or PIWIL3 specific antibodies or IgG as a  control, respectively, followed by detection of piR-13643 expression with  RT-qPCR. Immunoblotting of PRMT1 was detected in piR-13643 / PIWIL1 complex  immune-precipitates by Co-IP assay. Subsequently, PRMT1 protein expression was  detected by stably transfection of Flag tagged GLI1 (Flag-GLI1) into B-CPAP  cells. Methylation assay with PRMT1 and wild-type or R597 lysine (R597K)-mutant  GLI1. Then rescue experiments were applied to explore effects of piR-13643 and  GLI1 on the malignant behavior of PTC cells. B-CPAP cells transfected with  piR-13643 inhibitor were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to evaluate the  effect of piR-13643 knockdown on the xenograft tumor growth of PTC. RESULTS: piR-13643 was elevated in PTC patient specimens and cell lines.  piR-13643 overexpression facilitated cell proliferation, invasion and Vimentin  level, and restrained apoptosis and E-cadherin expression, whereas piR-13643  knockdown showed the opposite results. Mechanically, piR-13643 could bind to  PIWIL1 to form the PIWIL1/piR-13643 complex, and PRMT1 enhanced GLI1  transcription by methylating GLI1 at R597. Further, PIWIL1/piR-13643 promoted  PRMT1-mediated GLI1 methylation. GLI1 knockdown countered the effects of  piR-13643 mimic on cell malignant behaviors. piR-13643 knockdown preeminently  prevented the xenograft tumor growth of PTC in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that piR-13643 facilitates PTC malignant  behaviors in vitro and in vivo by promoting PRMT1-mediated GLI1 methylation via  forming a complex with PIWIL1, which may provide a novel insight for PTC  treatment.

(#)Contributed equally  The piRNA pathway is essential for female fertility in golden hamsters and  likely humans, but not in mice. However, the role of individual PIWIs in  mammalian reproduction remains poorly understood outside of mice. Here, we  describe the expression profiles, subcellular localization, and  knockout-associated reproductive defects for all four PIWIs in golden hamsters.  In female golden hamsters, PIWIL1 and PIWIL3 are highly expressed throughout  oogenesis and early embryogenesis, while knockout of PIWIL1 leads to sterility,  and PIWIL3 deficiency results in subfertility with lagging zygotic development.  PIWIL1 can partially compensate for TE silencing in PIWIL3 knockout females, but  not vice versa. PIWIL1 and PIWIL4 are the predominant PIWIs expressed in adult  and postnatal testes, respectively, while PIWIL2 is present at both stages. Loss  of any PIWI expressed in testes leads to sterility and severe but distinct  spermatogenesis disorders. These findings illustrate the non-redundant  regulatory functions of PIWI-piRNAs in gametogenesis and early embryogenesis in  golden hamsters, facilitating study of their role in human fertility.  © 2023.

Comment in     Elife. 2023 Aug 02;12:e90447. doi: 10.7554/eLife.90447.  Cell types are the building blocks of metazoan biodiversity and offer a powerful  perspective for inferring evolutionary phenomena. With the development of  single-cell transcriptomic techniques, new definitions of cell types are  emerging. This allows a conceptual reassessment of traditional definitions of  novel cell types and their evolution. Research in echinoderms, particularly sea  star and sea urchin embryos has contributed significantly to understanding the  evolution of novel cell types, through the examination of skeletogenic  mesenchyme and pigment cells, which are found in sea urchin larvae, but not sea  star larvae. This paper outlines the development of a gene expression atlas for  the bat sea star, Patiria miniata, using single nuclear RNA sequencing  (snRNA-seq) of embryonic stages. The atlas revealed 23 cell clusters covering  all expected cell types from the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm germ layers.  In particular, four distinct neural clusters, an immune-like cluster, and  distinct right and left coelom clusters were revealed as distinct cell states. A  comparison with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryo single-cell transcriptomes  was performed using 1:1 orthologs to anchor and then compare gene expression  patterns. The equivalent of S. purpuratus piwil3+ Cells were not detected in P.  miniata, while the Left Coelom of P. miniata has no equivalent cell cluster in  S. purpuratus. These differences may reflect changes in developmental timing  between these species. While considered novel morphologically, the Pigment Cells  of S. purpuratus map to clusters containing Immune-like Mesenchyme and Neural  cells of P. miniata, while the Skeletogenic Mesenchyme of S. purpuratus are  revealed as orthologous to the Right Coelom cluster of P. miniata. These results  suggest a new interpretation of the evolution of these well-studied cell types  and a reflection on the definition of novel cell types.  © 2023, Meyer et al.

Author information: (1)College of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Korea. (2)Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Pusan National University,  Yangsan, Korea.  Background: P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are  a type of noncoding RNA and are predominantly expressed in germline cells.  piRNAs function as gene regulators and potential biomarkers for the development  of a number of malignancies. The biological importance of piRNAs in ovarian  cancer is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of piRNAs  in ovarian cancer stem cells and compared it with that in adherent cells.  Methods: To assess changes in the expression levels of PIWIL1/HIWI, PIWIL2/HILI,  PIWIL3, and PIWIL4/HIWI2, we used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase  chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Changes in piRNA expression levels in ovarian  cancer stem cells were analyzed using Arraystar piRNA microarray screening. Gene  Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the potential  functions of piRNAs. Results: Using microarray analysis, we identified a cohort  of differentially expressed piRNAs. Fifteen piRNAs, including DQ570763 and  DQ597396, were downregulated, and 58 piRNAs were upregulated when compared with  those in adherent A2780 and SKOV3 cells (p > 0.05, >2.0, respectively). GO  functions of the downregulated piRNAs (DQ570763 and DQ570797) suggest that their  roles are commonly associated with the Golgi apparatus. In addition, A2780-SP  and SKOV3-SP cells had higher PIWIL3 and PIWIL4 mRNA levels than adherent cells  (A2780 and SKOV3). Moreover, we determined, using receiver operating  characteristic plot, that the expression level of PIWIL4 was lower in responders  than in nonresponders after treatment with platins in patients with ovarian  cancer. Finally, in ovarian cancer, PIWIL4 expression was associated with  somatic mutations of dynein axonemal heavy chain 2, signal induced proliferation  associated 1 like 2, YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein 1, TBC1 domain  family member 8, and LPS responsive Beige-like anchor protein.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest tumours worldwide, and its poor  prognosis is due to an inability to detect the disease at the early stages,  thereby creating an urgent need to develop non-invasive biomarkers.  P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI) proteins work together with  piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to perform epigenetic regulation and as such hold  great potential as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. PIWIL2 and PIWIL4 are  associated with better prognosis, while PIWIL1 and PIWIL3 involvement appears to  be associated with carcinogenesis. We aimed to discover PIWIL3- and  PIWIL4-modulated piRNAs and determine their potential mechanisms in pancreatic  cancer and the clinical implications. PIWIL3 or PIWIL4 was downregulated in  pancreatic cancer-derived cell lines or in a non-tumour cell line.  Differentially expressed piRNAs were analysed by next generation sequencing of  small RNA. Nine fresh-frozen samples from solid human pancreases (three healthy  pancreases, three intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and three  early-stage pancreatic cancers) were included in the sequencing analysis. Two  piRNAs associated with PIWIL3 (piR-168112 and piR-162725) were identified in the  neoplastic cells; in untransformed samples, we identified one piRNA associated  with PIWIL4 (pir-366845). After validation in pancreatic cancer-derived cell  lines and one untransformed pancreatic cell line, these piRNAs were evaluated in  plasma samples from healthy donors (n = 27) or patients with pancreatic cancer  (n = 45). Interestingly, piR-162725 expression identified pancreatic cancer  patients versus healthy donors in liquid biopsies. Moreover, the potential of  the serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) biomarker to identify pancreatic  cancer patients was greatly enhanced when combined with piR-162725 detection.  The enhanced diagnostic potential for the early detection of pancreatic cancer  in liquid biopsies of these new small non-coding RNAs will likely improve the  prognosis and management of this deadly cancer.

Normal testicular development plays a crucial role in male reproduction and is  the precondition for spermatogenesis. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are novel  noncoding RNAs expressed in animal germ cells that form complexes with PIWI  family proteins and are involved in germ cell development, differentiation, and  spermatogenesis. However, changes in piRNA expression profiles during early  testicular development in yak have not been investigated. In this study, we used  small RNA sequencing to evaluate the differences and potential functions of  piRNA expression profiles in 6-, 18-, and 30-month-old yak testis tissues.  Differential expression analysis found 109, 293, and 336 differentially  expressed piRNAs in M30 vs. M18, M18 vs. M6, and M30 vs. M6, respectively, and  found 30 common differentially expressed piRNAs in the three groups of M6, M18,  and M30. In addition, the functional enrichment analysis of differentially  expressed piRNAs target genes indicated that they were related to testicular  development and spermatogenesis. Finally, we detected the expression of the PIWI  protein family in the yak testis at different developmental stages and found  that PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3, and PIWIL4 were highly expressed in 18- and  30-month-old yak testis and almost not expressed in 6-month-old yak testis. In  conclusion, this study summarizes the changes of piRNA expression patterns  during the early development of yak testis and provides new clues for the  regulatory role of piRNA in yak testis.

In modern biomedical research, mice have been the mammalian model system of  choice to investigate molecular pathways for potential future medical  applications. Over the last years, it has become clear that female mice employ  an exceptional piRNA pathway-independent mechanism to neutralize transposon  activity in the ovary. In other model organisms studied to date, the piRNA  pathway is indispensable for efficient targeting of transposable elements and  fertility in both males and females. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated  that in other mammals, including humans, the piRNA pathway is highly active in  the female germline as well, indicating that the situation in the mouse female  germline is anomalous. For this reason, novel models to study piRNA pathways in  female mammalian germlines are currently emerging, including Bos taurus. Here we  describe a protocol for isolation and downstream processing of female bovine  tissues in order to perform downstream applications including piRNA sequencing.  © 2022.

A novel role for CFTR interaction with LH and FGF in azoospermia and epididymal  maldevelopment caused by cryptorchidism.  Hadziselimovic F(1), Verkauskas G(2), Stadler M(3)(4)(5).

Among boys  with cryptorchidism and abrogated mini-puberty, the development of the  epididymis and the vas deferens is frequently impaired. This finding suggests  that a common cause underlies the abnormal development of Ad spermatogonia and  the epididymis. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)  is an ATP-binding cassette transporter protein that acts as a chloride channel.  The CFTR gene has been associated with spermatogenesis and male fertility. In  boys with cryptorchidism, prepubertal hypogonadotropic hypogonadism induces  suboptimal expression of the ankyrin-like protein gene, ASZ1, the P-element  induced wimpy testis-like gene, PIWIL, and CFTR. The abrogated expression of  these gene leads to transposon reactivation, and ultimately, infertility.  Curative gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment stimulates the  expression of CFTR and PIWIL3, which play important roles in the development of  Ad spermatogonia and fertility. Furthermore, GnRHa stimulates the expression of  the epididymal androgen-sensitive genes, CRISP1, WFDC8, SPINK13, and PAX2, which  thereby promotes epididymal development. This review focuses on molecular  evidence that favors a role for CFTR in cryptorchidism-induced infertility.  Based on information available in the literature, we interpreted our RNA-Seq  expression data obtained from samples before and after randomized GnRHa  treatment in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. We propose that, in boys with  cryptorchidism, CFTR expression is controlled by luteinizing hormone and  testosterone. Moreover, CFTR regulates the activities of genes that are  important for fertility and Wolffian duct differentiation.  Publisher: RéSUMé: La cryptorchidie survient fréquemment chez les enfants  atteints de mucoviscidose et une altération du développement de l’épididyme et  du canal déférent a été observée chez les garçons cryptorchides avec une  mini-puberté abrogée. Cela suggère que le développement anormal des  spermatogonies Ad et de l’épididyme ont une cause commune. CFTR est. une  protéine de transport de cassette de liaison à l’ATP qui agit comme un canal  chlorure. Plus précisément, le CFTR a été associé à la spermatogenèse et à la  fertilité masculine. Chez les garçons cryptorchides, l’hypogonadisme  hypogonadotrope prépubère induit une expression sous-optimale d’ASZ1, de quatre  gènes PIWIL et de CFTR, entraînant la réactivation des transposons et  l’infertilité. Le traitement curatif à la GnRHa stimule l’expression des gènes  CFTR et PIWIL3 qui sont importants pour le développement des spermatogonies Ad  et la fertilité subséquente. En outre. Le traitement à la GnRHa stimule les  gènes épididymaires sensibles aux androgènes CRISP1, WFDC8, SPINK13, PAX2  favorisant le développement de l’épididyme. Cette revue se concentre sur les  preuves moléculaires en faveur du rôle du CFTR dans l’infertilité causée par la  cryptorchidie. Nous avons interprété les données d’expression de RNAseq obtenues  avec des échantillons avant et après un traitement randomisé à la GnRHa chez des  garçons cryptorchides bilatéraux dans le contexte des informations disponibles  dans la littérature. Nous proposons que chez les garçons cryptorchides, le CFTR  est. contrôlé par l’hormone lutéinisante (LH) et la testostérone et influence  les activités des gènes qui sont importants pour la fertilité et la  différenciation du canal de Wolff.  © 2022.

Aim: To understand the effect of HIV infection and cocaine exposure on piRNA  expression in human primary astrocytes. Materials & methods: We used small RNA  sequencing analysis to investigate the impacts of HIV-1 Tat and cocaine  coexposure on the expression of piRNAs in human primary astrocytes. Results: We  identified 27,700 piRNAs and analyzed them by small RNA next-generation  sequencing. A total of 239 piRNAs were significantly altered by HIV-1 Tat and  cocaine coexposure. We also identified PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3 and PIWIL4 as  interacting partners of piRNAs that were affected by cocaine and HIV-1 Tat  coexposure. Epigenetic changes in the expression levels of these piRNA targets  were associated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of energy  metabolism and neurodegeneration. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence  that cocaine exposure and HIV infection affect the expression levels of piRNA,  PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3 and PIWIL4.

Lower Spermatozoal PIWI-LIKE 1 and 2 Transcript Levels Are Significantly  Associated with Higher Fertilization Rates in IVF.  Giebler M(1), Greither T(1), Handke D(1), Seliger G(1), Behre HM(1).  Author information: (1)Center for Reproductive Medicine and Andrology, Martin Luther University  Halle-Wittenberg, Ernst-Grube-Str. 40, 06120 Halle (Saale), Germany.  The four human PIWI-LIKE gene family members PIWI-LIKE 1-4 play a pivotal role  in stem cell maintenance and transposon repression in the human germline.  Therefore, dysregulation of these genes negatively influences the genetic  stability of the respective germ cell and subsequent development and maturation.  Recently, we demonstrated that a lower PIWI-LIKE 2 mRNA expression in ejaculated  spermatozoa is more frequent in men with oligozoospermia. In this study, we  analysed how PIWI-LIKE 1-4 mRNA expression in ejaculated spermatozoa predicts  ART outcome. From 160 IVF or ICSI cycles, portions of swim-up spermatozoa used  for fertilization were collected, and the total RNA was isolated. PIWI-LIKE 1-4  mRNA expression was measured by qPCR using TaqMan probes with GAPDH as a  reference gene. PIWI-LIKE 1 and 2 transcript levels in the spermatozoa of the  swim-up fraction were positively correlated to each other (rS = 0.78; p <  0.001). Moreover, lower PIWI-LIKE 2 mRNA levels, as well as lower PIWI-LIKE 1  mRNA levels, in these spermatozoa were positively associated with a  fertilization rate ≥ 50% in the respective ART cycles (p = 0.02 and p = 0.0499,  Mann-Whitney U-Test). When separately analysing IVF and ICSI cycles, PIWI-LIKE 1  and 2 transcript levels were only significantly associated to increased  fertilization rates in IVF, yet not in ICSI cycles. Spermatozoal PIWI-LIKE 3 and  4 transcript levels were not significantly associated to fertilization rates in  ART cycles. In conclusion, lower levels of spermatozoal PIWI-LIKE 1 and 2 mRNA  levels are positively associated with a higher fertilization rate in IVF cycles.

Piwis are  primarily expressed in gonads and protect the germline against the mobilization  and propagation of transposable elements (TEs) through transcriptional gene  silencing. Vertebrate genomes encode up to four Piwi genes: Piwil1, Piwil2,  Piwil3 and Piwil4, but their duplication history is unresolved. We leveraged  phylogenetics, synteny and expression analyses to address this void. Our  phylogenetic analysis suggests Piwil1 and Piwil2 were retained in all vertebrate  members. Piwil4 was the result of Piwil1 duplication in the ancestor of  gnathostomes, but was independently lost in ray-finned fishes and birds.  Further, Piwil3 was derived from a tandem Piwil1 duplication in the common  ancestor of marsupial and placental mammals, but was secondarily lost in  Atlantogenata (Xenarthra and Afrotheria) and some rodents. The evolutionary rate  of Piwil3 is considerably faster than any Piwi among all lineages, but an  explanation is lacking. Our expression analyses suggest Piwi expression has  mostly been constrained to gonads throughout vertebrate evolution. Vertebrate  evolution is marked by two early rounds of whole genome duplication and many  multigene families are linked to these events. However, our analyses suggest  Piwi expansion was independent of whole genome duplications.  ©2021 Gutierrez et al.

CONTEXT: A genetic etiology likely accounts for the majority of unexplained  primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that heterozygous rare variants and variants in  enhanced categories are associated with POI. DESIGN: The study was an observational study. SETTING: Subjects were recruited at academic institutions. PATIENTS: Subjects from Boston (n = 98), the National Institutes of Health and  Washington University (n = 98), Pittsburgh (n = 20), Italy (n = 43), and France  (n = 32) were diagnosed with POI (amenorrhea with an elevated  follicle-stimulating hormone level). Controls were recruited for health in old  age or were from the 1000 Genomes Project (total n = 233). INTERVENTION: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES), and data were analyzed  using a rare variant scoring method and a Bayes factor-based framework for  identifying genes harboring pathogenic variants. We performed functional studies  on identified genes that were not previously implicated in POI in a D.  melanogaster model. MAIN OUTCOME: Genes with rare pathogenic variants and gene sets with increased  burden of deleterious variants were identified. RESULTS: Candidate heterozygous variants were identified in known genes and  genes with functional evidence. Gene sets with increased burden of deleterious  alleles included the categories transcription and translation, DNA damage and  repair, meiosis and cell division. Variants were found in novel genes from the  enhanced categories. Functional evidence supported 7 new risk genes for POI  (USP36, VCP, WDR33, PIWIL3, NPM2, LLGL1, and BOD1L1). CONCLUSIONS: Candidate causative variants were identified through WES in women  with POI. Aggregating clinical data and genetic risk with a categorical approach  may expand the genetic architecture of heterozygous rare gene variants causing  risk for POI.  © The Author(s) 2021.

One of the most common gynecologic cancers is ovarian cancer and ranked third  after the other two most common cancers: cervical and uterine. The highest  mortality rate has been observed in the case of ovarian cancer. To treat ovarian  cancer, an immune-informatics approach was used to design a multi-epitope  vaccine (MEV) structure. Epitopes prediction of the cancer testis antigens  (NY-ESO-1), A-Kinase anchor protein (AKAP4), Acrosin binding protein (ACRBP),  Piwi-like protein (PIWIL3), and cancer testis antigen 2 (LAGE-1) was done.  Non-toxic, highly antigenic, non-allergenic, and overlapping epitopes were  shortlisted for vaccine construction. Chosen T-cell epitopes displayed a robust  binding attraction with their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)  alleles demonstrated 97.59% of population coverage. The vaccine peptide was  established by uniting three key constituents, comprising the 14 epitopes of  CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), 5 helper epitopes, and the adjuvant. For  the generation of the effective response of CD4 + cells towards the T-helper  cells, granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was applied.  With the addition of adjuvants and linkers, the construct size was 547 amino  acids. The developed MEV structure was predicted to be antigenic, non-toxic,  non-allergenic, and firm in nature. I-tasser anticipated the 3D construction of  MEV. Moreover, disulfide engineering further enhanced the stability of the final  vaccine protein. In-silico cloning and vaccine codon optimization were done to  analyze the up-regulation of its expression. The outcomes established the  vaccine's immunogenicity and safety profile, besides its aptitude to encourage  both humoral and cellular immune responses. The offered vaccine, grounded on our  in-silico investigation, may be considered for ovarian cancer immunotherapy.

Many animals have a conserved adaptive genome defence system known as the  Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which is essential for germ cell  development and function. Disruption of individual mouse Piwi genes results in  male but not female sterility, leading to the assumption that PIWI genes play  little or no role in mammalian oocytes. Here, we report the generation of  PIWI-defective golden hamsters, which have defects in the production of  functional oocytes. The mechanisms involved vary among the hamster PIWI genes,  whereby the lack of PIWIL1 has a major impact on gene expression, including  hamster-specific young transposon de-silencing, whereas PIWIL3 deficiency has  little impact on gene expression in oocytes, although DNA methylation was  reduced to some extent in PIWIL3-deficient oocytes. Our findings serve as the  foundation for developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian  oocytes, including humans.  © 2021.

In animal gonads, transposable elements are actively repressed to preserve  genome integrity through the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. In mice,  piRNAs are abundantly expressed in male germ cells, and form effector complexes  with three distinct PIWIs. The depletion of individual Piwi genes causes  male-specific sterility with no discernible phenotype in female mice. Unlike  mice, most other mammals have four PIWI genes, some of which are expressed in  the ovary. Here, purification of PIWI complexes from oocytes of the golden  hamster revealed that the size of the PIWIL1-associated piRNAs changed during  oocyte maturation. In contrast, PIWIL3, an ovary-specific PIWI in most mammals,  associates with short piRNAs only in metaphase II oocytes, which coincides with  intense phosphorylation of the protein. An improved high-quality genome assembly  and annotation revealed that PIWIL1- and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs appear to  share the 5'-ends of common piRNA precursors and are mostly derived from  unannotated sequences with a diminished contribution from TE-derived sequences,  most of which correspond to endogenous retroviruses. Our findings show the  complex and dynamic nature of biogenesis of piRNAs in hamster oocytes, and  together with the new genome sequence generated, serve as the foundation for  developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes.  © The Author(s) 2021.

Follicular development and maturation has a significant impact on goat  reproductive performance, and it is therefore important to understand the  molecular basis of this process. The importance of long non-coding RNAs  (lncRNAs) in mammalian reproduction has been established, but little is known  about the roles of lncRNAs in different follicular stages, especially in goats.  In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of large follicles (>10 mm) and small  follicles (<3 mm) of Chuanzhong black goats was performed to investigate the  regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs and mRNAs in follicular development and  maturation. A total of 8 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and 1,799  DEmRNAs were identified, and the majority of these were upregulated in small  follicles. MRO, TC2N, CDO1, and NTRK1 were potentially associated with  follicular maturation. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEmRNAs involved in  ovarian steroidogenesis (BMP6, CYP11A1, CYP19A1, 3BHSD, STAR, LHCGR, and  CYP51A1) and cAMP signaling play roles in regulating follicular maturation and  developmental inhibition respectively. Five target pairs of DElncRNA-DEmRNA,  namely, ENSCHIT00000001255-OTX2, ENSCHIT00000006005-PEG3,  ENSCHIT00000009455-PIWIL3, ENSCHIT00000007977-POMP, and ENSCHIT00000000834-ACTR3  in co-expression analysis provide a clue in follicular development and  maturation of lncRNA-mRNA interaction. Our findings provide a valuable resource  for lncRNA studies, and could potentially provide a deeper understanding of the  genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of goat follicular development and  maturation.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, yet  molecular mechanisms underlying its origin and progression remain poorly  understood. With increasing reports of piRNA pathway deregulation in various  cancers, we aimed to better understand its role in OC through a comprehensive  analysis of key genes: PIWIL1-4, DDX4, HENMT1, MAEL, PLD6, TDRD1,9 and mutants  of PIWIL1 (P1∆17) and PIWIL2 (PL2L60). High-throughput qRT-PCR (n = 45) and  CSIOVDB (n = 3431) showed differential gene expression when comparing benign  ovarian tumors, low grade OC and high grade serous OC (HGSOC). Significant  correlation of disparate piRNA pathway gene expression levels with better  progression free, post-progression free and overall survival suggests a complex  role of this pathway in OC. We discovered PIWIL3 expression in chemosensitive  but not chemoresistant primary HGSOC cells, providing a potential target against  chemoresistant disease. As a first, we revealed that follicle stimulating  hormone increased PIWIL2 expression in OV-90 cells. PIWIL1, P1∆17, PIWIL2,  PL2L60 and MAEL overexpression in vitro and in vivo decreased motility and  invasion of OVCAR-3 and OV-90 cells. Interestingly, P1∆17 and PL2L60, induced  increased motility and invasion compared to PIWIL1 and PIWIL2. Our results in  HGSOC highlight the intricate role piRNA pathway genes play in the development  of malignant neoplasms.
