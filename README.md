I used 2 ways to rank the genes:
1. The number of all variants in that gene, including variants in the coding region and non-coding region;
2. The number of non-synonymous mutations in that gene, the mutation should be in the coding region and cause the amino acid to change.

Each approach generates a gene list and a vcf stored in genelist directory for downstream analysis.
