ARSA,O43681,ATPase GET3,"{'unspecified isoform': ['ATPase required for the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:17382883). Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors GET1/WRB and CAMLG/GET2, where the tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the GET1-CAMLG receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting. May be involved in insulin signaling']}",[],['17382883']

SUN2,Q9UH99,SUN domain-containing protein 2,"{'unspecified isoform': ['As a component of the LINC (LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, involved in the connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. The nucleocytoplasmic interactions established by the LINC complex play an important role in the transmission of mechanical forces across the nuclear envelope and in nuclear movement and positioning. Specifically, SYNE2 and SUN2 assemble in arrays of transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines which are bound to F-actin cables and couple the nucleus to retrograde actin flow during actin-dependent nuclear movement. Required for interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) and essential for nucleokinesis and centrosome-nucleus coupling during radial neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and during glial migration. Required for nuclear migration in retinal photoreceptor progenitors implicating association with cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin and kinesin motor complexes, and probably B-type lamins; SUN1 and SUN2 seem to act redundantly. The SUN1/2:KASH5 LINC complex couples telomeres to microtubules during meiosis; SUN1 and SUN2 seem to act at least partial redundantly. Anchors chromosome movement in the prophase of meiosis and is involved in selective gene expression of coding and non-coding RNAs needed for gametogenesis. Required for telomere attachment to nuclear envelope and gametogenesis. May also function on endocytic vesicles as a receptor for RAB5-GDP and participate in the activation of RAB5']}",[],[]

Acts via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and govern the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons. Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. Besides their function in transposable elements repression, piRNAs are probably involved in other processes during meiosis such as translation regulation (By similarity)']}",[],[]
